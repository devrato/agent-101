m0SNHvT6ybQ,Copy and Paste from Real Life!,Built into the iPhone viewfinder. And Google Lens.,2025-02-07T15:33:30Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0SNHvT6ybQ,1703065,92464,have you ever wanted to copy and paste from real life well you kind of can so you might have already known that if you take your iPhone's camera and point it at any text then this little icon pops up in the corner and when you do it pops up the text and lets you copy it and then you can paste it or or use it in real life which is great but if you've got something useful like a phone number instead of opening the dialer you can just point the camera at it again hit that little icon and it lets you pop it out and OneTouch call that phone number if you know you know if it's an email address one touch to start a new email to them if it's an address you can navigate straight there if it's a tracking number you can one click track that and another good one I found if you see a flight number the iPhone automatically surfaces all the info on that flight the airports the times the gates whether it's on time or not it's great also Google Lens the app does this on Android so if you haven't already looked into all the awesome stuff that Google lens can do do yourself a favor and check that out too but the more you know follow for more actually useful phone tips
SAb4zRyxrD4,Samsung Galaxy S25/Ultra Impressions: What Happened?,It's the same picture. Get an S25 Ultra case that'll never yellow at https://dbrand.com/ghost Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: ...,2025-01-22T18:00:39Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAb4zRyxrD4,5404010,153585,"(transition whooshing) (transition whooshing) (upbeat music) - Okay, so sometimes new phones come out, and people are basically like, ""Oh, it's the same as last year. It's basically last year's
phone with a new name. Nothing changed."" And that's mostly exaggeration. There are a few things usually that are at least worth talking about. But with this phone, I can honestly say there is nothing. Nothing dramatically new about the S25s. So welcome to your first look at the Samsung Galaxy S25 Series, S25, S25+ and S25 Ultra, plus my take on what's going
on with Samsung right now. So right off rip, very
familiar on the outside, right? With the standard phones,
without the new colors, I honestly don't think I
could tell the difference between this and last year. Same 6.2 inch and 6.7 inch
sizes, same flat sides, same cold design. If you really wanna get
into the weeds about it, they moved the 5G antenna
to the other side, up at the top there. So that's your tell that
you're holding the new model. But really all the changes
are gonna be on the inside. It's rocking the new Snapdragon
8 Elite for Galaxy chip, with a slightly upgraded vapor chamber, and 12 gigs of base RAM
across the board now. And then the Ultra, so the Ultra actually did get a little bit of a cosmetic update. Can you tell the difference? Just kidding. This is the S24 Ultra. This is the S25 ultra. Now, can you tell what they did? Same battery size, same
port and button layout, but this time, the sides are
just a bit more squared off and rectangular, and the rings around the camera
bumps are all a bit bigger. So the bezels are a little
bit smaller on the front, about 15% smaller. So there you go, a little more screen. That counts as a design update, I guess. But internally, Snapdragon
8 Elite for Galaxy again and a 40% larger vapor chamber. And it's also upgraded to the newest Gorilla Glass at the front. And there's a new 50
megapixel ultra-wide camera, replacing the outgoing 12 megapixel. Otherwise, the rest of the cameras and really the rest of the specs in total, from the battery to the
brightness, are all the same. Everything else new here is software. So we'll get to that in a second. But you remember when phones
used to do just the S update every other year? They would have a big jump
and then a small jump. And that small jump was like a
spec bump in the same design. This is the purest form of
just going back to that. Like this is basically a Galaxy S24S. And on one hand, how can
you blame them, right? Like the S24 line sold
really well for them. People loved those phones. The Ultra won my phone
of the year last year, so stick with the formula, if
it's not broke, don't fix it. But on the other hand, that phone was also really
similar to the year before that, which was similar to the year before that. So after a while, the design
does feel kind of stale. But like I said, most of
what's new is software, and specifically, you
guessed it, AI stuff. So there's a long list
of new Galaxy AI features launching on the S25 series, which have a range of
usefulness, I'll put it that way. So the biggest one is this new assistant that's triggered when you
hold the power button, and it looks like this. Now you can actually see it
says, ""Ask Gemini,"" in the box, but it's not actually pure Gemini. It's more of a hybrid of
Google Gemini and Bixby. So combining the best of both worlds. And obviously, Gemini is
gonna be better at most stuff and it will default to that, but some of Bixby's
ability to reach into apps and perform in-app actions is also here. So it's fascinating watching this work because for most of the stuff you ask, it just is Gemini, right? Ask some facts or some current events. But every once in a while, you can ask it something specific, like to add an event to your calendar, and then you can see it
take action and dig in and actually do it for you instead of just opening an
app and asking you to do it. And that's genuinely useful. Some people are gonna build
their whole lives around that, I'm sure. It's kind of funny. It doesn't seem like
you're able to pull it up with a voice command trigger. Like you can't just say,
""Bixby,"" and it comes up, or, ""Google,"" because it's both. So that's kind of weird. You do have to trigger it by
holding down the power button. It's basically Gemini
with some extensions. Anyway, what else? So there's another one
now called AI Select. So instead of the regular text selection, let's say you wanna select something a little more complicated, you swipe over from the edge panel or take a screenshot and invoke AI Select, and it'll use context to let you select
whatever's on your screen and do something more useful with it. So if there's a bunch of text
and you're reading an article, AI Select will surface writing tools, and then you can summarize that text, or at least the text that's
currently on your page. Or if you're watching a video,
you can pull up AI Select, and there's a tool to make a GIF of whatever's on your screen. So you can select the video
and a few seconds of it, and make a GIF super easily. I could have sworn they had a way of doing this with the
S Pen not too long ago and I just forgot about it, but shows you how much I used it. But, yeah, now making a GIF
is easy whenever you want. There's also now natural
language processing in the Settings and Gallery search. So you can just search
using regular sentences, and it'll actually find
what you're looking for by understanding you. That I think is pretty cool. It's useful. I know some less
technically-inclined people will get a lot of use out of this. And there's also some smaller stuff, like this Now brief widget, which is supposed to give
you AI-curated information you need to know at that moment. Certain useful things in the
morning versus the afternoon. And they also made an
equivalent audio eraser tool to what Google had just
added to the Pixel phones like a year or two ago. So now any video you have on your phone, whether you took it in
the camera app or not, you can clean up the audio
and isolate the voice by removing crowd noise
or background noise or wind or whatever with
a single button press. I wanna try and see how good it is. A lot of these AI features, it's taught me, if
you've heard this before, you know, they're cool
if they actually work, but it's debatable how much you're actually going to use them and how much value they
bring to this phone. But then the real kicker is, and this is technically a good thing, but Samsung has been really good about software updates lately. They're promising like seven
years of software updates on their newest flagships, which means that if most of
the new stuff on this phone is this software in the AI stuff, I didn't really see a whole lot of reason why most of it isn't going
to also be on the S24 in a couple weeks. So they're decently useful features. Some of them clever, some of them work offline
without an internet connection. Some of them power users will love, but it's obviously hard to use it as a reason to upgrade to this phone if you hold a decently new phone that already has some of
these features coming. The new One UI 7 that
I've been using in beta on my S24 Ultra for a few weeks, which is this whole, you
know, software overhaul and aesthetic code of
paint for Samsung's phones, I think that makes a bigger difference than any of the hardware stuff that they're changing about S25. Like you could give me right
now that new ultra-wide on the Ultra and I might not notice. You could give me the
slightly bigger screen, I might not notice. The new chip, maybe. But the UI, the software, it is a refreshed look
like across the board, fresh coat of paint with these aesthetics. And also, yes, some iOS-inspired features tucked in there too. The new lock screen
customization in particular. I mean, that's right along the same lines as the iOS lock screen update
we got a few years ago. So anyway, the S25 line is
absolute textbook spec bump. Zero risk for Samsung. And because of that, you could argue, probably zero risk for the
target demographic too. Now, make sure you get subscribed for the full reviews for these phones because they could
technically still surprise me. I know there's no IP69 and
no silicon carbide battery and no ultra-fast charging
and no brighter display, but is the Snapdragon
8 Elite for Galaxy chip going to be a big enough
bump that we notice it and maybe we don't even
need a much bigger battery? You know, is the new ISP on that chip gonna breathe new life into these cameras? All of this is TBD, so
I need to check it out. I also need to see if this new S Pen did in fact lose Bluetooth because there are rumors about that, and I didn't have time to check. But, yeah, there's still some wiggle room for us to form opinions
about these phones. So if you're thinking of
grabbing an S25 Ultra, you're probably already
considering which clear case to get because the only way you
can tell it from the S24 is by a new colorway. The thing about clear cases though is they all eventually start
to turn like yellow, like this, with the plastic, which just looks gross. So channel's sponsor, dbrand,
with their new Ghost Case 2.0 guarantees that their case
will never turn yellow. Like they literally have guaranteed that if it ever does turn yellow, they'll replace it for free. And I believe them too. One of the things I've
always liked about dbrand is that they always go out of their way to do right by their customers. So to give you an example, the other thing with clear cases is they can also get
scratched pretty easily, which was a problem with the
original Ghost Case at launch. So dbrand actually went out of their way to develop a new super
scratch-resistant 2.0 version of the case from the ground up and offered it as a free replacement to everyone who bought
the original Ghost Case, like 100% free. So if you want to get
a zero yellowing case and to support a company that consistently does
right for their customers, I will leave a link to
the S25 Ultra Ghost Case down below in the description. Either way, that's been it. Thanks for watching. Catch you out to the next one. Peace. (upbeat music)"
SCxnn2TpXQU,Your iPhone is Reading a Hidden Language,Actually useful smartphone feature you've never heard of: iPhones can read laundry symbols.,2025-01-13T15:43:55Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCxnn2TpXQU,967117,55102,all right so you know the laundry care instructions that are on like every tag that a piece of clothing has with the symbols on them I don't know what the symbols mean it's like a parking sign in New York City could mean anything but fun fact every iPhone with iOS 17 or later has a decoder built in for those symbols so all you have to do is find the tag and just take a picture of that tag then visit the photo of the tag on your iPhone and if you wait a few seconds that I button in the middle turns into a laundry machine because it has recognized the laundry tag symbols in the picture so click laundry care and you can see it's decoded and told you all the things you need to know about that exact garment now whether you choose to follow that or not that's up to you but you can see this sweater wants a Max iron temp of 150 do not dry clean do not bleach Etc it even works on these cleverly integrated symbols that aren't even on a tag like on MKBHD dcom merch so the more you know follow for more actually interesting hidden Phone features
ALghmqNSiG4,This Phone Shouldn&#39;t Exist...,Why?,2025-01-10T22:34:29Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALghmqNSiG4,2415855,130283,so this is the world's first color changing temperature sensitive smartphone the real me 14 Pro Plus so when it's normal room temperature this phone is a clean pearly white color but as soon as it gets cold this really vibrant blue pattern appears for some reason so this is because real me decided to put a thermally reactive pigment running through these veins in the back of the phone it's kind of similar to the thermochromic tech you see in mood rings or those color changing coffee mugs so it goes from white to Blue anywhere under around 15 Cel it's fun actually because it's so cold outside here that you can literally just go outside and in a few seconds your white phone turns blue and then when you come back inside it actually goes back to being white again so it's pretty cool I guess uh the funny thing is people still put cases on their phones and this phone comes with a black case so you might not ever even notice
-kuG6RgL32c,OnePlus 13 Review: The Bar Has Been Set!,"This phone is great, but... wait til this year of phones The wallpaper behind me: https://panels.art/w/rsu MKBHD Merch: http://shop.",2025-01-07T16:30:47Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kuG6RgL32c,3858541,123864,"(lively electronic whooshing) (groovy R&B music) - So I've been dailying this phone for about three weeks now. It's really good. But it's also really exciting because there are three
things in this phone that are going to be trends in
smartphones for all of 2025. So even if this phone isn't for you, there's gonna be a lot more phones like it that are really good, which is sick. So those three things are the
incredible battery, the chip, and the record-breaking display. So let's just get right into this battery. It's an easy place to start. This is the OnePlus 13, and it has a 6,000 milliamp-hour battery. This perfectly reasonably sized, kind of slim phone
without being super thick has a battery literally
double the capacity of the Galaxy S8. It's kind of nuts, actually. So if you've been keeping
track of phone battery sizes for the past few years, you might be wondering what is happening? Like, how is this jump all of a sudden happening
with a bunch of phones? Like the Galaxy S24 Ultra from last year, this, you know, full-size mega flagship, has an enormous 5,000
milliamp-hour battery, but yet suddenly there's
a bunch of new phones in the past few weeks that are not thicker that have a 5,500, 6,000, even
7,000 milliamp-hour battery. Like, what is happening? And the answer is silicon carbon. These new batteries, without
getting too technical, they are still lithium-ion batteries, but with a new silicon carbon anode or a mixture of silicon and graphite. But the results have really
spoken for themselves. They've been bangers. More energy density, obviously, but also enabling faster charging and a greater range of
operating temperatures. So pretty much great all the way around. It's also pretty new, so this is a bit of an
expensive technology. So it's gonna be in
flagships mostly to start, but this is the first part of a wave of new phones shipping with them. This will be great for small
phones having better batteries. This will be great for folding phones like we've seen already
with the Honor Magic V2, which is impossibly thin but has 5,000 milliamp-hours of capacity. And that is absolutely
how we got this OnePlus 13 being thinner and lighter
than the OnePlus 12, yet having a 10% larger battery. It was honestly hard to
find a day to challenge it and try to drain the whole thing. The truth is, even with
my high brightness use, plenty of multitasking, this is a two-day phone at 120 hertz, and I turned it up to high resolution. I had days of, like, hours
of, you know, GPS navigation, high brightness, a whole
bunch of stuff happening, Bluetooth streaming, a whole ton, and I'd end the day with
six hours of screen-on time, and I'd still have 35% battery left. So I basically can't kill it in a day. It's sick. But when it finally does get low, it has 80-watt fast charging, so it can go from zero
to 100 in 36 minutes, and it supports 50-watt wireless charging with the right charging pad. This is the best that
smartphone batteries have been since the beginning of
the modern smartphone. I promise this is a great battery, and there's gonna be a lot more like it. That's the exciting part. Hell yes! So that's number one, the battery. Number two is this new
chip inside, as well. This is the Snapdragon 8
Elite chip in this phone. And, you know, this new chip comes out every year from Qualcomm, and a bunch of us flagships use it. And typically, we see, you
know, 5% improvements here, 10% improvements there if we're lucky, and that's respectable. But this year the improvement
over last year's best has been way bigger. It has a 31% higher CPU clock speed. It scored 36% higher on
the AnTuTu benchmark, 44% higher on the single-core Geekbench. It jumps up 14% on 3DMark. Like, this thing is putting
up Wilt Chamberlain numbers; I'm loving it. Now, if you're just opening up Instagram or flipping through emails, it kind of sounds like none
of this is gonna matter, and you'd mostly be right. But I love to see this
type of jump on both power and efficiency because it
means if you're pushing a chip, it's been shown to hold high frame rates and high power outputs for
longer without throttling. But if you aren't gaming and you are just bouncing
around casual apps or scrolling Blue Sky
or emailing or whatever, it turns out your battery
efficiency gets much better, too. So this chip has been
great in a couple of phones that it started to show
up with late last year: ROG Phone 9 Pro, Red Magic 10 Pro, great performers, great gaming phones, but now it's gonna also start to show up in regular flagships. I'm pretty sure Galaxy S25
lineup's gonna have this chip, and it's gonna be great, too. So lots more phones to
also have that this year. So number one is the battery; it's great. Number two is the chip; it's great. Number three, last but not
least, is around the front, and it's this display. Holy nits! So I called this a
record-breaking display earlier, which might not mean much
because, you know, every year there's been a new record-breaking phone with the highest max nits. This is another one on that streak. 1,600 nits in high brightness mode, 4,500 nits peak brightness. And apparently, this is
the world's first display that's gotten an A++ from DisplayMate, whatever that means. I feel like I'm getting
DXOMark flashbacks here. What you really need to know
is this is a big display that looks really good all of the time, and it achieves that because, on paper, it absolutely does not miss. It's 6.82 inches corner to corner; QHD+ resolution, so it's nice and sharp; 120-hertz LTPO. It's mostly flat with,
like, just the very edges curving over just slightly. So I can forgive that. It has great viewing angles. And it just gets insanely
bright from corner to corner, and it can get super dim, as well. Plus, it has 2,160 hertz
high-frequency PWM dimming for those with sensitive eyes. And there's an ultrasonic
fingerprint reader underneath that's crazy fast. And it also has a new glove
mode for increased sensitivity while wearing thin gloves
and Aqua Touch 2.0, which does a great job at
keeping the screen responsive when there's water on it, which a lot of older phones struggle with. The peak brightness
number, the 4,500 nits, you know, it's an
impressive, very big number, but it doesn't really mean that much. It can't do that on all
of the pixels at once. And also the OnePlus
12 had the same number. But it's more just about the
crazy full-screen brightness. If you're out in the sun taking pictures, or if it's up in your dash, like, this screen gets insanely bright, and it's surrounded by basically no bezels that are even all the way around. What more could you ask for from a screen? So, look, I'm excited for
a bunch of other phones to also be coming out this year with the same impressive big
three that this phone has it. They can have this awesome
battery, this great chip, and an incredible display. But what you may have also noticed is that is three of my five
pillars of a great smartphone. The other two being build
quality and cameras. And this phone does pretty
good with those also. So I think the design
and build is pretty nice. This is good hardware. There's three colors to pick from. And they do this thing
where the base version, which is 900 bucks, is only
available in the black, but then the upgraded one for 1,000 bucks you can get in any color, including this nice blue
vegan microfiber leather. It's kind of soft to the
touch, and I like it. But there's also still an alert
slider on the flatter sides, which is a crowd favorite. I personally use it every day. The vibration motor inside is super good; it's really precise. And OnePlus has also hilariously
leveled up their IP rating, their certification for
water and dust resistance. It's not IP68; it's IP69. It's nice. Which means it can be not just submerged but also can sustain
high-pressure water jets at extreme temperatures, which is crazy. And it's also funny because
I remember a few years ago, OnePlus not wanting to pay
for IP certification at all. So now they're on the total opposite end. This phone can survive the laundry or being in the dishwasher
if that happens to you. Now, there's no Qi2 magnets
built into this phone, but I really like what
they've done with their cases. So they've got these official cases that have magnet rings in them, and they are basically the
exact same diameter as MagSafe. So now this phone with this case on it works with all of my MagSafe accessories. And I know that might
not seem like a big deal since most people buying this phone, you know, don't already have an iPhone and a bunch of iPhone
accessories lying around. But what it does do is basically unlock a whole world of
accessories for this phone. So with this case on, I've been using all my MagSafe
phone mounts in the car or any MagSafe charger or dock. They all work and just lock
right in firmly with the magnet. It's great. Maybe the only design
downside that I don't like is the camera bump is kinda
awkwardly slightly to one side, but that's not a huge deal. Speaking of cameras, though,
that's the other pillar. And this phone has a solid set of cameras. It's definitely not its strength. And this is kind of,
you've seen this before. This is the OnePlus story,
where they have fast phones, super smooth, great
charging, and all that, it's just the cameras are a
notch below other flagships. It's not a bad camera; it's just if you're gonna have an awesome, specced-out flagship but also
undercut the other flagships, then you gotta save a
little money somewhere. So the OnePlus 13's primary camera is the 50-megapixel Sony LYT-808 sensor with an f/1.6 aperture, essentially the same as the OnePlus 12. It is clearly... Look, it's gathering a lot of light, and the pictures during daytime and in nice conditions are really nice. It's even good for a
little soft depth of field with close-up subjects. And it does a good job
of freezing moving action and has good autofocus. It's just that performance
drops extra hard when the light goes away, which feels like an obvious statement. It's like saying a tire loses traction when the ground is wet, but
it's just a little worse than other competing flagships here. So it gets a little softer, gets a little HDR-y
more often with lights, and is definitely a victim of the make-every-dark-photo-look-bright
syndrome that we've observed in a
lot of phones in the past. Rarely is anything
actually in a deep shadow with this type of processing. And then there's also a
50-megapixel ultra-wide and a 50-megapixel, 3X
tri-prism telephoto camera, which offers some space
savings over a periscope zoom, but that's about it. And their performance in the dark is worse than the main camera. Video quality is definitely
passable, though. I like that basically every
new flagship phone now can shoot 4K60 from all three lenses, and this one can also shoot
8K30 from the main camera. This is the fifth generation of this OnePlus/Hasselblad partnership. And I remember when it first
got announced back in the day and people were wondering
if this is gonna be anything special or if it
was more along the same lines of what we've seen from,
like, Sony and Zeiss or Xiaomi and Leica. And to be honest, apart from, you know, some portrait mode stuff and the orange shutter button and a few tweaks to their pro mode, honestly, it's turned out to
be right in line with those. There wasn't some dramatic
reinventing of color science or suddenly a huge
revolutionary new sensor, but it's just a little
bit better than before. It's fine. I mean, people, again,
you're not buying this phone just for this camera,
but it's not a disaster. It'll hold up, and it'll be fine. Now, something you might have noticed, AI is not yet one of my
pillars of a great smartphone. It's not really close to the list yet, but it is in some of this OS. There are some features with AI built-in; in the camera and some
operating system stuff. But honestly, the OS is more important. You could argue that could be a pillar, and I think some people will
buy this phone just for the OS. And I think they'd be right. OxygenOS 15 is still so fast and smooth and brings Android 15 features and a tiny bit of a coat of
fresh paint over a lot of things along with some, shall we
say, familiar elements. Like they added this little
Dynamic Island copycat feature. So, hey, if you liked
Apple's Dynamic Island, well, you'll feel right at
home with the OnePlus 13. They're actually called
Live Alert capsules, but it also literally shows up in settings if I search Island. So (chuckles) I think they
know what they're doing. But anytime music is playing
or if you have a hotspot or a screen recording going on, this little bubble pops up
around the selfie camera, and then you can tap it to bring up a card with the controls for that activity, and then you can always long press to jump into the app itself. So look, if you're gonna copy stuff, copy the good stuff, right? Also, I have to at least take a second, and I don't know how
to feel about this yet. Maybe I'm curious what
your takes are on this. But there's this whole genre of phone testing videos I've seen mostly on Twitter
where all they really do is they just open and close apps super, super fast, a
bunch of them in a row, just to test the animations like this. And a part of me is like, what? That's not how anyone uses their phones. Like, who cares? I wouldn't have known if
my phone passed that test or failed, whatever. But also, OnePlus has
specifically seen those tests and optimized this phone,
changed the animations, to do really well on that test now. So here's the Galaxy S24 Ultra doing this and the OnePlus 13. I promise it's not something I would take into consideration
when buying a phone, and I don't think I'd even
notice it for everyday stuff, but I guess it's impressive
that they've done it. They've optimized this animation chain. Thanks? Honestly, though, as a whole,
OxygenOS on this phone, it's gonna be pretty familiar to anyone who's used any previous
OnePlus phones or Oppo phones with a couple AI features
sprinkled in now. Like, I still think Circle
to Search is awesome. There's also an AI editor
in the stock camera app now with things like AI Unblur
and Reflection Eraser, and Detail Booster, some of
which work okay sometimes, but also other times they're
still very obviously AI and not that good, and all of which require an
internet connection to work. And there's also some writing features that can do things like summarizing or adjusting tone or proofreading text, but it only works in
the OnePlus Notes app, which is a fine app, but
it would've been nice if it worked in other places, too. And it also requires
an internet connection. They usually call me a bit of a skeptic on a lot of these AI features
actually being useful. But in general, like I said, the software, smooth, super fast. It's really good. And it will be a reason why
some people would buy this phone over, say, a Vivo flagship, for example. Well, that and the price. But yeah, OnePlus trying
to undercut other flagships by being slightly cheaper than them. We've seen it before; that's their formula, and
they're sticking to it. But I'm excited about the
fact that everyone else can also stick to their formula this year, and it still means we're gonna
get much better batteries, chips, and displays across the board. So I think we're winning here. Sick. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace. (groovy R&B music)"
nffJx51swVQ,The World&#39;s Largest Golf Simulator,,2025-01-05T19:02:08Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nffJx51swVQ,1229459,54481,[Music] so so this is a regular golf simulator and this is the largest and most advanced golf simulator on the planet and I got to use it so this is sick so I partner with Best Buy to give you guys behind the scenes look at how Tech is changing the game of golf forever turns out they've built this massive indoor facility to create a new and I think pretty awesome looking new version of golf basically like Arena Golf and it's called the tgl so this time the screen they're hitting into is is 64 ft across by 53 ft tall so it's the size of an apartment building and it's lit up by nine overlapping projectors don't ask me the resolution I don't actually know this one but what I do know is hitting into this thing is like hitting into a portal and another dimension or something it's kind of sick so here's how it works for the full shots the pros yes Tiger Woods Rory MAOI all these guys will hit from this area which has three lies a real grass rough a real Fairway and real sand and when they hit it gets measured by these launch monitors and these launch monitors and adjusts for what type of golf ball it is and it only needs to see about 1 second of ball flight before immediately projecting the rest of the ball flight on this huge simulator screen with perfect accuracy it's awesome but okay here's the crazy part so once they hit it onto the green they turn around and then that exact green is waiting for them to hit real putts on there's a laser projector in the ceiling that will put a dot on the green to show exactly where the ball should be placed and then they hit from there and then this green has hundreds of motorized risers that can go up or down to create new Hills and new break for New unique putts every single time I think this is the coolest Golf Tech I've ever seen maybe even crazier they've designed new golf courses for this league and they're all a variant of this green and bunkers but at different angles so they put this entire green on a massive turntable so they can spin it around and match every single hole the golfers play with perfect accuracy so yeah they can make literally millions of different green combinations with all the adjustments available here I think I could stay forever in this thing but I'll have to let them finish building the arena so the pros can play in it and I'll be watching when the tgl launches this January so whether it's golf or any other Obsession you have you can take what you love to the next level with Tech from Best Buy sh

XXPjZwYY4z4,The Harry Potter phone comes with a WAND 🪄,,2024-11-16T17:17:15Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXPjZwYY4z4,403535,23654,this is a Harry Potter Edition collab phone also known as the Oppo Reno 12f and again right from the unboxing experience it's pretty dramatically customized so this thing starts with this huge box including a wax sealed envelope containing an invitation to Hogwarts but it is for Mr Potter though so not for me but then there's a whole bunch of other accessories and other things included with this phone which is custom branded in this shimmery bronze color with a silhouette of Hogwarts on the glossy stripe down the middle there's also a Harry Potter branded fast charging brick and cable there's an enormous Deathly Hallows themed SIM card ejector tool there's a golden snitch in the Box complete with flapping wings and then it comes with a whole wand which actually also has a stylus tip so you can do some very specific screen off gestures and it will open apps like the camera or the flashlight or the calculator which is kind of hilarious plus of course there's built-in wallpapers for each of the houses so only thing missing I guess is maybe sorting you into one of the houses
z19HM7ANZlo,The M4 Mac Mini is Incredible!,The new $599 M4 Mac Mini is really good. In more than one way. MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com Apple Mac Mini M4: ...,2024-11-07T14:00:39Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z19HM7ANZlo,6475220,173037,"(box clunks) (tape tearing) (chilled lo-fi music) (wrap rustling) (upbeat electronic music) - So usually, one crazy thing
about a new piece of tech is enough to get my attention, just something out of
the ordinary about it. But this new Mac mini has three things about it that are insane. So instead of having an event this year, Apple decided to do a bunch
of press releases in a row for the last week of October to update their whole Mac lineup to M4. And one of them was for this new Mac mini. Now, a lot of us might not give too much thought to the Mac mini, like, yeah, maybe it
holds an important place as the most affordable Mac, but if you're not buying one, you're not really thinking
about it too much. But the number one most insane
thing about this refresh is, well, I mean look at it, it's tiny. It is absolutely tiny. Apple's gone through and redesigned basically all of their computers now that have gotten the Mac silicon update. Well, except this one, this is the same design as a while ago, but the Mac mini was kind of technically overdue for a redesign. And the new one, it actually
kinda looks a little bit more like a shrunken Mac Studio
than a shrunken old Mac mini. But it's now a five inch
by five inch footprint and two inches tall. I'll say that again, a five by
five by two desktop computer. Now I like small desktops, and yes, you could get a
tiny desktop computer before, there's plenty of amazing
mini ITX build videos all over the internet that
I've watched for years. They're sick. But there's levels to this, there's small computers and
then there's tiny computers. And this Mac mini is smaller
than my R5 with a lens on it. It's smaller than a new roll of duct tape. It's smaller than the
footprint of the new iPhone and barely bigger than the
absolutely tiny Apple TV. Apple's seemingly had this obsession with making certain computers
as small as possible, even before Apple silicon came along. So this has just kind of
unlocked another level for them to push it even further than ever before. Yeah, there are fans in here, but there are also ports on the back. Gigabit ethernet by default,
full size HDMI is still here. And then three Thunderbolt
ports on the back and then there's two
USB-C 3 ports on the front plus the headphone jack. So still no SD card reader. And there's obviously now no more USB-A. If you tried to build or buy another computer
to match this thing, you will either end up building a computer that's just as small but
nowhere near as capable, or a computer that's just as capable, but nowhere near as small. It is just a hilariously
unnecessarily tiny computer. It's great. I would also like to start
a new conspiracy theory. I would like to use this video
to start a conspiracy theory. I think that there is someone
whose job it is at Apple, someone whose sole purpose
(sinister mysterious music) is to come up with one obnoxious
thing to complain about for every new Apple product redesign. Like this is the person that
put the notch on the iPhone. This is the person that
put the charge port at the bottom of the Magic Mouse. And this person's best work is right here on this new Mac mini, putting the power button
on the bottom of it. Like, why? There are so many better
places to put a power button, like at the front or the side, or literally anywhere on the back, like all the other small Mac desktops. Or at the top. That
would've been fine too. But no, they chose behind the back corner, which is (sighs) just... I mean, I don't use
that button very often. I don't really turn the Mac on and off with a button almost ever. I might sleep it and wake it back up, and maybe every couple of weeks, I'll have to remember that
the button's back there. But yeah, it's just dumb
enough to get memed on and complained about without
actually being an issue. Well played, guy. But yeah, you know, the
typical consequences of a computer getting smaller are battery, speakers, and thermals. There's just less room
inside for those things. Battery of course doesn't make a huge difference on a desktop, who cares? Speakers, kind of the
same thing, who cares? And thermals have been redesigned in a way that seem to be working just fine. This thing hardly gets over a peep. If you do heavy stuff,
the single fan spins up and you can hear it, but
it's always been quiet, sitting on the desk,
you can hardly hear it. So then the number two insane
thing about the new Mac mini is that the base model is kind
of an incredible deal now. No, like I don't think you understand it. I think it's actually one
of the best deals in tech. It's certainly the best out of any of Apple's new product
offerings right now. And I mean, I'm kind of
not used to saying it, but it is a really good deal. So this base M4 Mac mini costs 599, right? So for that, you get the base
computer with the M4 chip, which has quietly doubled
to 16 gigs of unified memory instead of eight from before. So the 10 core CPU and the 10 core GPU. Now we're four generations
into Apple silicon and the gains are
actually kind of starting to stack up versus M1. We already know it was a huge difference from the Intel chips, but I
actually wanna get a little bit more into that in the MacBook Pro review because I've been using
an M1 Max MacBook Pro for three years since it came out. And the M4 Max is the first one that's actually tempted me to upgrade between generations of Apple silicon. It's really interesting. So get subscribed and
stay tuned for that video when it comes out. But the main thing you need to know is this base M4 chip is great, it's super solid and power efficient at everyday normal
activities like web browsing and music streaming and
multitasking like crazy. And it can handle what
I think I would call medium-grade activities very easily. Not heavy stuff like
graphically-intensive gaming or a heavy video editing, but pretty much anything short of that. This could be a coding
and developing machine, this could be a photo editing machine. Pixelmator runs like a dream. And fun fact, Apple just bought
Pixelmator, interestingly. But yeah, just having
a ton of Arc tabs open, stuff like that, like just
running around, multitasking, it runs like a dream, it's great. It's as good as you'd expect the world's fastest single
core performer to do. So yeah, Mac mini, you know,
four years, like I said, it has been the most affordable Mac, the sort of entry point for
anyone to get into Mac OS. But this year with the
doubling of the base memory, it just feels like a
particularly good deal. Think of it this way, the M4 iMac that also just got refreshed is basically the exact same computer, but just in an upright desktop with a non replaceable display. That starts at $1,299. So you can use that $700 difference to kind of get whatever screen you want. Now, you can obviously also
upgrade from the base Mac mini, but I don't think you
should, and I'll explain why. See, Apple is known for building what I've called a price ladder, and they're just trying to get you to climb as high as possible. They do this across all their products, but there's basically always
a really tempting upgrade sitting right above the base model. And then when you spend that money, you're kind of right underneath
another tempting upgrade, and then they kind of walk you up, trying to get you to spend
as much money as possible. It's really smart, they do it with iPhones and with iPads and with everything else. This base Mac mini, I'm
telling you is a good deal, but it only has 256 gigs of storage. And many people are fine with that and they can live with that, that's great. But if you know you're gonna
be working with a lot of media, a lot of video, then you start looking at
upgrades to the storage, and that's where you'll
find that walking it up to a terabyte costs 400 more dollars. Or if you plan to do
some wired networking, bumping it up to 10 gig ethernet costs 100 more dollars on top of that. for the price of just those upgrades, you could almost get an
entire nother MAC mini. It's crazy. Like basically, across the board, Apple's upgrade pricing is
pretty crazy with this computer, which is why I'm specifically saying the base model is such a good deal. And actually if you're lucky enough to have a .edu email address right now, the student discount drops it
down to 499, which is sick. But once you know you're
gonna be doing upgrades to the pre-purchase spec, which you have to know before buying it, 'cause you can't upgrade
it after the fact, all the memory, everything is built in, then it becomes more of a normal deal. I do wanna say this though. So the third and final crazy
thing about this Mac Mini is that the maxed out version has a case for the best portable workstation Mac. Now this doesn't apply to everybody. This is coming from me, someone who used to drag an
iMac Pro in a Pelican case through the airport to events because it was the fastest editing machine that I could reasonably travel with, and it actually made sense for me. So coming from that perspective, this new Mac mini is sick. So looking at the Mac Studios, those aren't upgraded to M4 yet, they've all got the M2 generation. And it's also not gonna be the Mac Pro, which is also still on the M2 generation and obviously not portable. The iMac is on M4, but there's no Pro chips, so
it's just the base M4 chip. So this Mac mini is the easiest way to pack an M4 Pro chip with you and just throw it in a
travel bag super easily. An equivalent spec'd
MacBook Pro with M4 Pro starts at $2,000, which is actually another
decently good deal as far as performance. But if you don't need a laptop
or if you just wanna plug and play into monitors wherever you go, 1399 gets you the M4 Pro Mac mini. And that upgrade also gets
you the back Thunderbolt ports being Thunderbolt 5
instead of Thunderbolt 4. So it can support three 6K
displays instead of two. So I've had and been
testing the M4 Pro here with 48 gigs of memory, and fun fact, if you run through
some synthetic benchmarks, this runs up the highest CPU
score of any desktop Mac ever. That includes the Mac Pro and the Mac Studios and all of them. This is by far the most
powerful single core we've ever seen by a lot. And then Multi-Core just barely tops Geekbench's all time Mac list, though as we know, CPU doesn't
really bump up all that much when you go from base
to Pro to Max to Ultra, it's way more GPU stuff. And so when you look at GPU benchmarks, the most powerful Mac
mini here with the M4 Pro, it was putting up M1 Max numbers, which again, shows how much
these generations over time have been improving and
stacking on top of each other. I've been editing videos
on an M1 Max laptop for three years now on the MacBook Pro. So this Mac mini feels like one of those impossibly small computers Apple's like always
kind of wanted to make, even before Apple silicon. Like you probably remember
some of their earlier attempts, like the ""Trashcan"" MAC Pro, no doubt, they wanted do something crazy. They wanted to put a
workstation-class computer on the desk cooled by a single fan. We saw how that went with
the Intel chip inside, or even some of those
razor thin i9 MacBook Pros that started having overheating issues. But now that Apple silicon
has gotten this good and this efficient over time, they're actually able to
make tiny, powerful computers like the Mac Studio and now like this little
Mac mini over here. Nobody was asking for the
Mac mini to be even smaller, except for those people
in the Spaceship Campus somewhere in California. Well played. Well played. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace. (chilled electronic music)"

fgm5uZaS3-E,The Tesla Robotaxi is Confusing...,"The Robotaxi event was a lot. These are my thoughts, plus a test ride and some extras. Full unedited Cybercab ride: ...",2024-10-14T23:37:50Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgm5uZaS3-E,4681849,158002,"(gentle music) - Okay, so the Tesla
Robtaxi unveiling event was a couple days ago and it might be the weirdest tech event I've ever been to. You might have seen some
clips from it at this point. I was there, I rode in
the self-driving Robotaxi. I explored the insane looking Robovan and I talked to the Optimus robot and then I left feeling kind of confused. It was a weird event. So here are the three
main big reasons why. So first of all, the robo
cab, this was the main thing that we knew we were going
to see, this full unveiling of a fully self-driving Tesla. And we saw it and it looked like this, very, very much like a mini Cybertruck. Like you've got the
light bar on the front, the light bar on the back, the complete lack of rear visibility. Then, of course you can
see it's a two-door, two seater passenger car. People were wondering like what a full self-driving
robo cab or cyber taxi, whatever we're calling it
would actually look like whether it'd look dramatically different from a normal car like a
Model 3 or even a Waymo. And there are some things that
are significantly different about this thing they rolled out. I mean on the outside it's light gold. Every single one is this
like silvery gold color, although there was never any
mention of actual materials. Pretty small footprint,
you can see there's no exterior door handles, or
mirrors, or anything like that. And then, since they don't
need any steering wheel or pedals, they can sort of push the seating position way
back into this more like loungey seating position kind
of near the middle of the car there's a center armrest and there's a massive 21 inch
touchscreen in the center. And yes, the doors go up
as if Tesla hasn't learned from their lessons of the Model X, they're making another crazy set of doors which, honestly, is
definitely a hit visually. It's a striking feature of
this car alongside the wheels which, at first, just look
like these huge gold discs. But then, when you take a closer look, they're actually just normal 21 inch low rolling resistance continental tires. But they've painted half
of the sidewall gold to match the caps in the middle. So it makes it look like a
super thin low profile tire with a huge wheel, but
it's not, it's just paint. But either way, no idea how
much of this is gonna make it to any sort of final production. But after waiting in line for a bit, I got to ride in this
thing for a few minutes. So I got in, the screen told
me to buckle my seatbelt, and once I did, the door
automatically closed, pretty smart. Then I just selected the destination, which was on this screen along this route, which I assume was pre-mapped. And then it just started
rolling, just started going. Now, I've been in a
self-driving Tesla before, but this one is just a
little bit more nervy since there's people everywhere and there's no steering
wheel in front of me. But once you get over the eeriness of basically being trapped
in this driverless car with no manual override,
I started looking around and noticing a few other things. You know, you sit pretty low to the road, similar to a Model 3,
but with more leg room since the seating position's further back. And then, there's even
fewer physical controls than ever before in this car. Like I basically only found
that the window switches were in the middle next to the cup holders. I didn't even see any door latches. Like the doors only opened with a button on this enormous touch screen. So again, like a Tesla, it's
gonna control everything in the car on the screen
including just watching movies while the car is driving because why not? So you can watch the entire trip that I took uncut on
the auto-focus channel if you want, I'll link that below. But then the thing is
that's kind of all we got. Like there were shockingly
few details about the actual car actually
explained at this event other than basically like
the three main pillars which are gonna be in all the
headlines which are number one that it will be fully
unsupervised, self-driving capable. Number two, that it'll
be able to be purchased for under $30,000, all right. But then number three, that
it would actually also charge by inductive wireless charging. So it pulls up over this
wireless charging pad on the ground and it
would charge that way. Not something we've seen
shipping in very many cars, especially not ones with large
batteries, but that was it. No other numbers, no other specs. Just look at this thing,
there's just concepts of a plan. I just had so many other
questions after seeing that. Like what is going on here? I did at the event walk
around after the announcement and bump into some Tesla engineers and people who had been
working on these things. And so, I just ended up
kind of grilling them. Like I asked them a
whole bunch of questions. So I'm gonna tell you guys
what I learned from them and I guess we can take their word for it. So first of all, there
is no steering wheel or pedals, as you can see
so my first question was, all right, let's say I
see an accident coming or there's something happening
on the road in front of me and the car isn't reacting in time, is there a manual override? And the answer I got
was, sure, there will be some sort of minimal
onscreen controls available, but the goal is that you
never have to override which is a noble goal, for sure. I just mean it's hard to imagine. We live in a world
where that's impossible, basically, right now but I mean, even with the wireless charger, picture you wanna like drive over the top of it and line it up perfectly because if it's off a little bit, that's just a giant waste of power. But if I can't adjust it
like that would be terrible. But speaking of wireless charging, you might be wondering why
they would try to do this? The main answer, again,
is because they want it to be totally autonomous. They want people to just
be able to own several, like a fleet of these things
and they all just drive around and charge themselves overnight. And the whole cable
plugging in charging thing requires a human so that's
one less human required. It'll just line up on the notoriously inefficient wireless charger. But my question again was, okay, is there at least a charge port
so if I want to supercharge or charge quickly, I can do that? And the answer was, no, there is no charge port on this vehicle. So it is not even capable of
hitting a Tesla supercharger, or doing any sort of road trips, or anything like that, it's purely a taxi. I'm told there is no
plans for a front trunk. There's just the rear trunk that they showed in this presentation. And there's no planned range
or a stated battery size. But what they did say
is they're simply aiming for this vehicle to be
as efficient as possible, that's their main goal,
between the aerodynamics and the low rolling
resistance tires, they think they can aim for about 5.5
miles per kilowatt hour. Some of the most efficient
electric cars we see today are getting around 3 to 4
miles per kilowatt hour. So this would be like
an A plus efficiency, if they achieve this and
that's what will let them use a smaller overall size battery for the lighter weight of the vehicle. So it'll be nice, they're
saying, to clear 200 miles of total range and that would put this at maybe a 40 kilowatt hour battery pack instead of the typical 70 to 130. So drive train wise, that
logic does check out. You wanna make the cheapest,
most efficient electric car of all time, you gotta hit those things. But then again, you're
also telling us this while doing a car with scissor
doors and wireless charging. So you're gonna have some
challenges there, for sure. But really I think the obvious red flag, the biggest red flag to me
is the timeline stuff that, I mean this is notorious Elon stuff. He gets on stage, he
says, ""We're gonna have ""this vehicle out for
$30,000 before 2027."" No they're not, there's just no way that they're actually
gonna be able to do that. I mean if they do, let's say they do, I will shave my head on camera 'cause I'm not confident they won't do it. Like I wanna be optimistic,
but there's just too much stacked up against it because in order to ship this at all with no steering wheel and everything, they have to get all
the regulatory approval for the full self-driving and all that, and get all the prices
down in spite of inflation and ship something with scissor
doors and all this stuff in the next two years,
there's just no way. Tesla's been promising full
unsupervised self-driving for years over and over and over again and consistently keeps pushing it back. But then also just
price-wise, I get the goal, but Tesla promised a $35,000
Model 3 and years later I think they briefly
actually shipped that car for that price for a little
bit before discontinuing it. Cybertruck, I don't know if you remember, do you remember the base price of what they said the Cybertruck would cost at the cheapest version when it came out? $39,000 and that was about what, like four or five years ago? Do you know what the cheapest
Cybertruck is right now? $95,000, so you can see where
my skepticism is coming from. But even after all that, you know, there's kind of a
philosophical question too which is what is the
difference between this, this Robotaxi thing and a Model 3? Because Tesla has been promising for years that the car that people are driving and buying today is gonna be capable of full unsupervised self-driving, like the Model 3 and the Model Y? And it's actually not clear if there's that many differences. I mean, obviously, okay, one's
gonna have a steering wheel and four doors and four
seats and the whole thing and maybe be a bit more expensive. But like, yeah, if my car is gonna be able to do all that stuff I think I want the one that can plug into superchargers and do all sorts of carrying things. Maybe this will be an old fashioned way of thinking at some time in the future, like every car on the road is autonomous and it's like an ""old
school"" thing to want the one with the steering wheel that
you can drive sometimes, maybe. I think the main
advantage of the Robotaxi, if it has the exact same capabilities as a Model 3 is it'll
be cheaper, and smaller and easier to operate
in a fleet situation. That will probably be the main difference as far as actually buying these things because they've been
selling people the dream of the car that you buy and own today, you'll drive it to work and
then, when you're at work, it'll go drive people around as an Uber for 10 hours or however long and then, you drive it home when you need it and then, when you're
sleeping it'll continue to drive and Uber people around. And so, it has all these
amazing capabilities, it'll do all this great
stuff, but will it though? There's actually a moment I had to re-watch the event 'cause I was there and people are like
yelling out the whole time like stuff at Elon on stage. And at this point in the
presentation he goes like, oh yeah, Model 3 and Model Y
will also do full self-driving. And then someone goes like,
what about the Cybertruck? And then he says, oh yeah,
don't worry, Cybertruck too. - So and Cybertruck too, yes, of course. Sorry, I don't wanna forget, yes, yes. All our cars, basically. - So yeah, okay, all our vehicles great, but then it's kind of quiet, but then someone else yells
out, ""What about Hardware 3?"" Which is, basically if you don't know, a reference to older Model 3s. And his response... - So... [Audience Member] Hardware
3, Hardware 3, Hardware 3. - Let's not get nuanced here. - [Audience Member] What?
- All right, next slide. - So yeah, let's not get
too nuanced, all our cars will have it except maybe
some of the old ones. All our cars will be able to
self-drive though, totally. We'll cross that bridge when
we get to it, how 'bout that? But here's a bridge that I don't think we'll ever actually get to cross, which is the second thing that was insane that was announced at this
event, which is the Robovan. So somewhere about halfway
through this presentation, they roll out this one of one super futuristic looking
massive van thing. Kind of looked like a... It looked like the military vehicles from
""I, Robot,"" to be honest, which that's probably not a good thing. But yeah, it rolls out and they give us, again, very, very few details. This is gonna be a Robovan that can hold like up to 20-ish people and it, again, will be fully electric
and fully autonomous and take groups or teams of
people from point A to point B. No manual override necessary, great. Have you ever been to CES? Have you ever watched videos from CES? Every year in January
there's this trade show, it's really fun, in
Vegas and if you ever go, you'll notice in the south hall there's a section with all the
cars, the mobility section. And you'll find about 50 of these, every year there's just like
a van with no steering wheel and a bunch of seats
that all face the middle. And it's like the future
of mobility concept. There's tons of those. None of them ever ship, of
course, because there are rules. But I guess there's
not, to me, a whole lot that differentiates that brief concept we saw at the Tesla event with dozens of other vaporware versions of this that I've seen before,
that's all I'm saying. I mean, the fact that
this one comes from Tesla is the main differentiator,
this is the company that could maybe
theoretically make it happen. But like I said, there's almost
no details about this thing. And I have almost no faith that
that thing that they showed with its minimal clearance,
and its glass everywhere and just lack of numbers or anything I don't think that we'll
ever actually see that thing. I could eat my words, but
like that seems crazy. But then last but not least,
Tesla decided to bring back... They decided to remind
us that they're also an AI company, not just a car company by bringing back out the
Optimus humanoid robot again. So they had these things all
over this event this time, dancing, doing these pre-rehearsed demos. But also, they were just
kind of out and about. They were serving drinks and snacks and they were walking
around and interacting with and entertaining people
just like hanging out amongst everyone at this event. Now, I already have my thoughts
that I've talked about, you know, humanoid robots before. I made a whole video about
it, if you wanna watch it, I'll leave a link below the Like button. I've talked about Tesla's Optimus. But even just what we saw with that, would've been a huge step forward
from what we've ever seen. Like this would've been one of the most impressive things ever. But then, they decided to take it further. They also decided to have
these robots talking to people and, I mean, it was way
too fast to be an LLM. Like just watch this clip. - [Optimus] Would you
like a piece of chocolate? - I will take some chocolate. - [Optimus] Right on, what's your name? - [Vanessa] Vanessa. - [Optimus] Vanessa? - Yes, Vanessa. - [Optimus] Nice, pleasure
to meet you, Vanessa. - Nice to meet you too.
- [Optimus] I'm Optimus. - [Optimus] Have a great night
- [Vanessa] Great Optimus thank you.
- [Optimus] Bye. - Like it's just a person, it's a person talking through a speaker. It it even like stutters and makes occasional like human mistakes. If you watch a bunch of
videos from the event, a bunch of different robots all have slightly different voices. Yeah, it was a person, for sure. And it's weird because Tesla, at no point, at least as of the time of recording, has not acknowledged this at all. They haven't said that or confirmed that, but people there at the event
have heard various things from various engineers,
I talked to two engineers who only would tell me,
yes, all of the LLMs do run totally on device. But like, yeah, no, I don't think so. So this kind of became
like the talking point of the whole event, like now we don't know how much of this event
was real or not so real. Like how much of what
these robots are doing is human controlled or AI. You know, there were all
kinds of hand waving, and gestures and movements. I played charades with one of them. You know what it reminds me of? Remember that video I did at
Disney's Imagineering Labs where they had these bipedal robots that were controlled by
a steam deck controller? They did all kinds of walking around and stringing animations together to entertain people at the parks. There's just a bunch of button presses and controllers to make that happen. And sure, there's some
AI to blend that stuff, but you could never deny that there's, basically, entirely human
control happening here. And that's, basically,
what I think is happening at this Tesla event, lots of impressive and entertaining things in the form of a super advanced articulating robot stringing animations together. But it's just not totally ready
to do this stuff on its own. We've never seen anything quite like it, even from Boston Dynamics,
but we gotta be real about the human assisted part. But the thing is, the dream that they are selling people
with this specific robot is that this thing will
live with you basically, it will be your human
sized friend, actually. They said that it would be your friend, it would do chores for you,
it would live around you and be able to do all these
sorts of tasks on its own using the AI and the vision-based system. I think that's a really far off dream. AI is really, really quickly improving. But I still think that's a far off dream. So, you know, to their credit,
this event, it was insane. Like they did a lot of things
that could have gone wrong. And if you told me in 2024 that a company would do a bunch of self-driving car demos around tons of people
just loose in the road and they would have bipedal
humanoid robots roaming around performing tasks
and entertaining people at the same event and that they would have a drone show like that
is just a lot of stuff in a row that is super high tech that could go wrong, but somehow didn't. And it represented, I think,
a very optimistic view of the future, even though
it's very much still like concepts, it's a future that is potentially way more efficient,
potentially way safer and more impressive in
general technologically than the world we live in today. So that by itself, I think is honorable. The things that they
were hoping to be real would be amazing and inspirational and honorable if they actually happened. But since they are also
a public tech company, they felt the need to do demos and give all these big promises. And that's where it felt
weird because it's really hard to make promises about when
we're gonna deliver this future and for what price we're
gonna deliver this future when it just feels very unlikely. And then doing the like, robots talking, it's just like now the
whole thing is in question. Like how much of it is real,
how much of it is fake? And then, now we're focusing on that instead of how cool the future
could someday actually be. That's where I'm at but
hey, if there is one company that has the best chance of
bringing this all to life, if you made me bet money on one company that I think has the best
odds to get there eventually, then, yeah, it would be the one with the massive data gathering advantage with stuff out there in
the real world today. It would be Tesla so I'll
believe it when I see it. Thanks for watching, catch you
guys in the next one, peace."
xiJMjTnlxg4,AI is Stealing my Videos,,2024-07-16T18:20:01Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiJMjTnlxg4,2400579,119253,so there's a story that came out today and the headline was that Apple trained AI models on YouTube content without consent including MKBHD videos there's no statement from Apple on this yet but here's my take the real story is apple and a whole bunch of other tech companies are training their AI models using data that they buy from third-party data scraping companies some of which get their data in slightly illegal ways so one of them pulled tons of transcript data from thousands of YouTube videos including Mr Beast videos and my videos and many more so that company is a problem and that's going to be an ongoing evolving problem for many years and also Apple can technically say they're not at fault for this but they're going to keep getting data from companies like this so that's also something they need to vet but the double Emmy is I actually pay for more accurate manual transcriptions on every video that we put out so that people who are hearing impaired don't have autoc captions which suck so that means the stolen transcriptions specifically are paid content that's being stolen more than once
_q45HmRIM08,CMF Phone 1: Fun Modular Budget Phone!,"""What a knob"" was my alternate title"" CMF Phone 1: https://geni.us/HfpQq MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com Tech I'm using ...",2024-07-08T15:23:00Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q45HmRIM08,2649489,91119,"(logo chiming) (soft upbeat music) - All right, so CMF Phone 1 by Nothing is kind of a confusing name, but what this phone's trying to do, not confusing at all. Love it or hate it, this is one of the most
interesting new phones in the world at the moment. Because Nothing came along
a few years ago and said, ""Hey, what if we tried to
make an average budget phone ""but with a focus on software and design?"" And it kinda worked, those
phones are pretty good. And so now, CMF is the
budget sub-brand of Nothing, and they've come along and said, ""Hey, well, what if we did
the same thing but even more?"" So that's how you end up with this. This is a $200 Android phone that on paper doesn't
really stand out specs-wise in the sea of other $200
Android phones that you can get but it absolutely does stand out with its software and design. And I just wanna start
with the design first because that's the most interesting thing about this phone by a mile. So this is the CMF phone in black. And on the surface it's
nothing too crazy, right? It's got flat sides, pretty average bezels all the way around this big AMOLED display, and dual cameras up in
the corner on the back. But then you realize two things, first, there's a knob, like a dial down here at the
bottom corner of the phone. And second, there's also a
bunch of these metal screws all the way around the outside. And that's because this plastic
back is completely removable and replaceable in a
couple different colors, there's black, there's also
orange, there is a blue and there is a light blue, which also kinda has a
little green hue to it depending on who you ask. So right off the bat, this
idea is pretty unique. Like for any phone,
especially at this price, I remember back in the Moto
Maker days a while ago, you could sort of customize your phone but that was also much more permanent. And it's been many years since we had removable backs on phones. And even though nothing else comes off and the battery isn't removable and the back still feels
super cheap and flexible, because it is, but once it's on the phone, it feels pretty rigid and sturdy and it's still cool to see the
ability to change the color and it's a convenient little upsell for the company that's
selling the phone itself for so cheap. So then in the box for the cover, you also get this little
orange combo sim ejector tool and flat head screwdriver
since you'll need this tool to remove the sim card tray and all of the screws to get the back off. And then it comes with a
matching sim card tray and dial to pop on the back so that
everything matches up. But you can also totally
mix and match if you want, it kinda makes the phone maybe feel a little bit more like your own. So the color changing back is one thing, but then there's also this
knob I keep pointing at down here in the corner, and
this is a separate feature. So I remember they first
started teasing this on Twitter, we were trying to figure out
like on the Waveform Podcast, like what is this gonna be? Is this a volume knob? Is this gonna be just like a fidget toy or is it a mapable
thing with the software? Like what's the knob? And it turns out, it's a
mounting, attaching point, for some accessories. So it's not like something
that spins freely, it's kinda just a fancy
thumbscrew with a colorful cap. And if you take it off, you can replace it with one of three accessories
that they've made so far. There is a kickstand, which lets you prop up your
phone on like a flat table or a surface. There's also a card holder wallet, which lets me put up to
four cards in the back and then slap it on the back with magnets and carry it around with me. And there's a lanyard, not sure how many people are gonna put their phone on a lanyard but you now at least have the option to, you can securely attach it
to the corner of the phone. So is this a gimmick? I'm gonna vote no, I think
that kickstand is the one thing that I would actually
want to have on my phone or at least the option to have
on my phone whenever I want. It's kinda nice that that's
available for it but in general, it's just the main point of it
is it's one more useful thing to separate it from
other phones at 200 bucks in the design department. I was gonna say, it feels kinda
like an ultra budget version of MagSafe where instead
of having magnets, you literally have to screw
the thing onto your phone. But then I realized, wait,
this magnet accessory, which is the plate that you screw under the back
of your phone for the wallet, connects with this
suspiciously familiar looking ring of magnets in the middle. So just for kicks, I slapped
a MagSafe mount on there and it stuck like really well. So I actually think if you
want to buy like a car mount or some accessory to attach to this phone, I actually think you
could buy a MagSafe one. This is the Moment MagSafe puck and it will hold the phone from the back, so the more you know. Now it obviously takes a bit of work; several screws, the sim card ejector tool and the twisting and all that to take these accessories
off the back of the phone and put a new one on, so this isn't something
you'd probably do every day or multiple times per
day or anything like that but it works. You have the ability to. And then when there's nothing
on the back of the phone, this dial actually kind of
protrudes the exact same amount as the camera bump in the opposite corner, so it prevents it from
rocking back and forth at all. Well played, CMF, well played. So they've got lots of neat
little hardware customizations but the other important
thing about a phone is what it's actually like to use. So I've been using the CMF Phone 1 for the better part of about
a week now and to be honest, it feels just like I'm
using a Nothing phone, which is a compliment. Matter of fact, it's literally
running Nothing OS 2.6 and aside from the light
up glyph interface, it's not missing a single feature that the more premium
nothing phones actually have. It's got the cloned apps feature where you can have more than one instance of a single app installed. It's got Game Mode, it's got the clever little
one-handed pull down gesture where you can pull down the
notifications without reaching. And of course, all the aesthetics, you know, the icon pack,
the home screen widgets, the dots font, all that fun stuff. You still have that
spot where you can view all of your notification
history, underrated feature. You know, it behaves exactly
like a Nothing phone. And using this phone, I can honestly say that
there were stretches of time where I'd forget I was
using an ultra cheap phone. Like it's a fairly bright
responsive display, it's typically five to 700 nits, but it's an AMOLED that
peaks at 2,000 nits. And it's adaptive between 60 and 120hz with a 240hz touch sample rate, so it's decently smooth and quick. So just flipping around through the daily inconsequential stuff like scrolling through social
media or reading emails or light web browsing, for that stuff, of course, this phone is
totally fine, super smooth. The chip powering everything here is the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 5G. It's about on par with
the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 as far as benchmarks and they pair it with either
six or eight gigs of RAM, depending on what spec you get, it's really decently well
equipped for 200 bucks. But you can definitely get this phone to show its price though,
like it's not perfect. These aren't complaints, these are just facts about the trade-offs you obviously have to make to
get a phone to be this cheap. So like this phone has a 5000mAh battery and a really solid battery life, but there's no wireless charging and of course, there's no
charger included in the box. If you're wondering though,
it supports up to 33 watts. But then this phone also has no NFC, it has a really crappy
cheap vibration motor. It has a single mono speaker
down here at the bottom that's surprisingly easy to
just block with one finger. The optical under screen
fingerprint sensor, I actually think that's pretty impressive for this price range but it's also been noticeably
on the slower side for me and sometimes ask for multiple
reads before unlocking. And then these plastic backs, you know like I said, they feel fine when they're attached to the frame of the phone,
but like a car bumper, when they're not attached to the frame, you can really feel how flimsy they are. These are plastic, the
buttons in here are, they feel like they're
literally held on by elastic that I feel like I could
snap at any moment. I mean, they haven't yet but
they just look like they could. And of course with removable backs, the whole phone can't be
super water resistant, so it's just IP 52 rated,
basically just good for a splash. And we all know budget phone cameras have never been anything special, this phone is rocking a Sony sensor. It's a 50 megapixel primary
sensor for the camera and it takes, I would
say, serviceable photos. They're not terrible, I would say. You know, it's an IMX882, so
it's actually the same sensor that's in the POCO F6
and the Realme 12 Pro and some other pretty budget phones, and also the Moto Edge for some reason. But anyway, there's also no OIS so when
the light starts going away, it gets rough pretty quick. And then that second sensor up at the top, well, that's not a camera at all, that actually, it almost
never really does anything. Turns out it's just a depth sensor for specifically shooting
2X Portrait Mode photos to get a bit of a cleaner,
more accurate bokeh cutout. But it didn't also complain
much at all when I took photos with it covered or anytime
while shooting actually. So, hey, budget phones make sacrifices, that's not a new concept here but I like the set of trade-offs that they made with this one. I mean, squinting back at it, it doesn't look bad for a $200 phone and I think the set of
trade-offs that they made in the name of really
good design and software, I like it. Now this phone is mainly
targeted towards India, that's the market that it's supposed to
be most competitive in, and in that market, yeah,
there's other cheap phones. They're a little more expensive than this but they will also have like the two years of software updates and three years of security updates. They will also have big screens
and relatively thin bezels and MediaTek chips. They're usually not AMOLEDs though, so that's good about this one. And a lot of 'em will also
have micro SD card expansion, which this phone also has. Probably the only notable
missing thing is NFC but just the sheer amount of time I was able to enjoy the using this phone and not thinking about its price
'cause of how smooth it is, all the software features it has, that's pretty sick. It's the $200 phone engineered
to look cool, basically. And CMF has also just introduced a bunch of other stuff as well. There's a new smart watch, $69, nice. Also a new set of earbuds, $59, so to give you an idea of
what they're working on. But let me know what you think, that's my review of the CMF Phone 1. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys on the next one. Peace. (bright upbeat music)"
kkX8_nbBqBQ,Android 15 Hands-On: Top 5 Features!,Android 15 features are more subtle and hidden than ever. These are the best ones MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com Tech ...,2024-05-28T21:40:15Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkX8_nbBqBQ,3547528,129421,"(light music) - Hey, what's up, MKBHD here
and I've got the latest beta of Android 15 on my
Pixel 8 Pro right here. So a lot of you know, I've done these videos for a long time. Like I've made a video
on the best features of the latest version of Android for I don't know how
many years in a row now, since they were naming 'em after desserts. And if you've been watching all of these, then you've noticed a trend, which is there used to
be huge new features and massive like visual
overhauls and all sorts of crazy gigantic things
changing with Android. But now things have
stabilized, I would say. It's a lot more small changes and more nuanced things here and there. So it's gotten to the point
where these top five features of Android 15, back in the day, this would've been like a .0.2 update. Like, these are smaller and smaller new features with each new version. But on the other hand, that
actually feels like it is... They're a little more well considered. They're more about usefulness, they're more about little tweaks here and there to make actually using and owning your phone a little bit better. So I can appreciate that. And I will also say it, it's felt like in videos in the past, I've said that, you know, this is a version
that's only gonna show up on the Pixel for at least a year and you may never get to see
the newest version of Android, but I feel like with a lot
of the newest companies actually promising a good amount of software updates into the future, hopefully more people will actually see these couple of things. So I'm just gonna jump right in. These are the top five best features I've found in Android 15. So number five is called
Private Space and it's, yeah, it's exactly what it sounds like. It's a private space on your Android phone for your top secret files and photos and whatever else you got in there. So to turn it on, you go to Settings and then Security & Privacy and then Private Space is near the bottom. So you confirm it's you and
you pick a Google account and a new lock if you want. Then this Private Space is set up and basically you can
always find it all the way at the bottom of your app drawer, like that's where it lives. So obviously, if you were to
like give someone your phone to borrow for a while, you
could put it in Guest Mode and it would just basically be a brand new phone for them set up. But yeah, Private Space is different. It's more of just a separate section under a separate lock underneath the phone that you're already logged
into and signed up for. So it's basically a
whole new little section of your phone hidden
away behind a second lock for your top secret activities, apps, files, photos, whatever you want. And when you wanna hide it
away again, you just hit Lock. You could put whatever you want
in there, totally up to you. Then number four, so I'm kind of combining a lot of these things. I've done this in videos in the past. It's just a whole bunch
of the little things that sort of stack up to feel like a more refined experience. So number four is the little things. Like, one of them is rich widget previews, which obviously is not a huge thing 'cause how often are you actually adding new widgets to your home screen? Not very much. But when you do now, the widgets that support this will
actually show you content that will actually be on
them before they get added and they're in live and real time and represent real things on your phone. This could have maybe
been higher on my list, but at this point it's so new that it's basically only
like two of Google's apps. Like, it's just the clocks
and widgets around that. But it would be nice
to see more Google apps and even more third party apps adopt this. Like, I want to see, in the
example widget before I add it, like one of my actual notion
boards instead of a made-up one or one of my actual contacts
instead of a random person. Another one is this new back animation when you move backwards
through like settings or anything with multiple
layers that you can back out of. I think it's a little bit
smoother, a little nicer. Another one is Bluetooth audio sharing. You can have multiple headphones paired to the same Bluetooth audio source as long as they support Bluetooth LE, which most new headphones do. Another one is High Quality Mode when you use your Android
phone as your webcam. Another one is Bluetooth Auto On. So if you turn Bluetooth
off on your phone, then the next day it automatically
gets turned back on again so you don't have to remember to. And there's just a whole bunch
more little things like that. It feels like every year
Google pays attention to the little things about
the way we use our phones and then can add stuff to help us there. But speaking of little things, I'm making number three by itself one of those little things, which
is the new volume sliders. So right now when I hit Volume, it looks the way it normally does, the Auto Live Caption button
is still there on the Pixel, totally underrated feature, and then your mode switcher at the top. But then when you hit
the three dots to expand, you get this whole almost
full screen overlay showing where you're playing audio to and then all of the sliders for volume of everything happening on your phone. And this is something, you
know, that's been smaller and in various other forms and
previous versions of Android, but I like this big one. Just makes it super clear what's going on and how loud each individual
thing is going to be. So then now we're getting to the top. Number two is partial screen recordings. So I think normally when you do a screen recording on your phone, you just expect to see everything, right? You just start it, it's your home screen, it's every single app you switch between, everything happening on your phone. That's a normal screen recording. But I've been playing with
screen recordings here on the Pixel with this dev preview and it's a lot smarter about only showing if you want individual single things happening on your phone. So when you go to initiate
a screen recording, you can either do the entire screen, which is normal, or a single app. So check this out, if I do single app and then start recording,
it gives me a picker to choose which app I want to record. I'll pick one of the
ones I already have open, Relay Reddit, just for this example. The countdown starts at the top and then it's recording this Reddit app. So I can scroll around,
just use it as usual, but now watch, if I go home and then open another app like Photos and then scroll around in here, and then go back home,
go back to the Relay app, then scroll some more,
that's the screen recording. Now check this out, when you go to watch the screen
recording, it looks normal, but then the moment I go
home and then go to Photos, see, that doesn't show up
in the screen recording. It's still just recording the Reddit app even though it's in the background now. And then you can see when I get back to it and starts scrolling some more, it picks up where it left off. So it's only specifically
showing what I want you to see. And this is super useful. I think this is my new
default for screen recordings. You don't have to see, you know, a random text message I have coming in or me copying and pasting a security code from another app or anything like that. It's just me giving you a tutorial on like one exact thing
that I wanna show you. That's pretty cool. But then number one, this
is one of those things that Android has been really good at and had the edge at for years, which is just better notifications and notification management. And so far with these two previews, it's even better in
specifically a couple of ways. There's Adaptive Vibrations, there is Notification Cool Down,
there is custom vibrations, there's a whole bunch of stuff,
so I'll walk through each. So Adaptive Vibration is fascinating. It kind of just seems like another one of those magic-feeling Google things, but you go into Vibration
Settings and just turn it on, there's no further settings. But it basically says it's
using your phone's mic and other sensors to determine
the sound levels around it and potentially even what
type of surface it's on to set the strength of vibration so you can always feel or hear it. So the idea is if your phone
is on like a desk somewhere or a hard surface, it doesn't have to rattle the thing at maximum strength to be heard, it can turn it down. But then if it's on a
couch or something softer, it will pick that up and
it will vibrate more loudly or more firmly so you can
actually still hear it, clever. And then there's another thing
in Dev Preview 1 at least that was called Notification Cool Down, which is literally just a setting to be able to help you manage when you get a ton of notifications from the same app over and over in a row. 'Cause we've all been in that
group chat that's going nuts or the Slack channel that won't shut up, or Asana or whatever, something that's just
constantly pinging you over and over with the same app. And so Notification Cool
Down, when you enable that, will just sort of taper that
off and keep you updated on when a bunch of new
stuff comes in, but not just buzz you over and over.
(fingers tapping) Now that was in Dev Preview 1 and then this is Dev Preview 2 and it's not in this one, it's gone. I'm not sure why, but I
hope they bring that back. I hope they keep it
'cause that's pretty sick. And then there's even
more subtle one that's, 'cause it's basically hidden to users, this is something developers have seen, which is individual
vibration patterns per app. 'Cause see, some of you
aren't old enough to remember when smartphones had LED
notification lights on them, multicolor lights that would actually have a different color light up based on what app you were getting
a notification from. So I could know, without
waking up my phone, if I had a blinking blue light happening, oh, that's a Twitter
notification, I can ignore it. Or if it was a blinking green light, then it's a new Gmail
notification and I can ignore it. But if it's a new blinking red light, then it's a new missed
call and I can ignore it. But then phones all got
rid of these lights. So now we wake up our phones every time I wanna check on something. And if you have it always on
display, that can be useful. But in a surface shown to developers, they have the ability now to customize their own vibration pattern
specific to their app. So I think that's pretty sick. I'm kinda hoping, and this
is totally just hoping, but I hope that they surface
that to users as well. I hope, just like I've been able to pick between a bunch of
different weather icon apps for my one app that does weather, I hope they let me choose between a couple custom vibration sounds or vibration patterns for apps because I would love to customize and feel that I've gotten
a Twitter notification and that I can still ignore it. Now for those wondering,
since we check every year, when you go into Settings, it doesn't actually say Android 15, it says Vanilla Ice Cream
for this Dev Preview 2. And when you click into it,
this is the animated Easter egg, which looks nothing
like vanilla ice cream, but for what it's worth, it's
a little more space-like. But now here's the thing, if
you hold it down long enough, it speeds up all the way and then snaps and turns into this, this
sort of random spacecraft in the middle of what seems
like a nearly infinite canvas. Kinda reminds me of that asteroids game from back in the day. But you don't shoot anything, you just kinda fly around
using this thrust vector and explore this gigantic space. The only thing that worries
me is that in the corner, it says BODIES: 0 / 10. So I think if people explore
this thing long enough, they're gonna find bodies,
whatever that means. But yeah, like I said, a
bunch of subtle things, some new notification
stuff here and there, some new management usage
of your phone type stuff. It's nuanced, it's subtle. I'm still excited for some of
the bigger AI-based features to drop because that's the
stuff that we're expecting to make a big difference
the way we use our phones. It's just not built into Android anymore. It's the AI stuff that
your phone is capable of that's not in the OS.
(soft music) It's still good to see
good OS features too. Lemme know what your favorite one is or if you agree with my order of the top five in the
comments section below. Thanks for watching, catch
you in the next one, peace. (soft music continues)"
B3szaVzQx0o,Google Pixel 8A Impressions: Just Get The 8!,Google drops Pixel 8A. But Pixel 8 is still goated. Get a dbrand Hydrodip skin at https://dbrand.com/shop/hydrodip Google Pixel ...,2024-05-07T16:18:33Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3szaVzQx0o,2785953,87587,"(bright music) - All right, so there is just one thing that's starting to feel a little bit weird with this new Pixel, but I'll get to that by
the end of this video. Let's just start with the obvious stuff, what's actually new here? So I just got some hands-on time with Google's new budget phone, the Pixel 8A, and I can confirm they're mostly sticking
to the script here, keeping it simple. Last year's phone was already really good, making a few key
improvements where it counts and keeping the price the same, $500. 500 bucks isn't cheap, but
it's also not a flagship. It's definitely in this nice
little mid-range territory, and I feel like the Pixel has been slowly catching up their hardware to the rest of the competition
in this price point. So at first glance, it is, well, pretty unmistakably a Pixel
with the camera bar up top. But there's a little change, there's a little bit more rounded edges. I really hope I'm not the only one getting round-SpongeBob
vibes from these corners, but that's definitely what I see. But that's the main
design change back here. And then also around the back, it's still got wireless charging, it still has the same main camera sensor as the 7A with an ultra-wide next to it. But now there's new colors
and this new matte texture. So there's a black and a white that are called Obsidian and Porcelain, which look pretty tame. But then there's also a new green and blue called Aloe and Bay, and they are definitely more vibrant. The rails and the camera
bar are all aluminum still. It's still IP67 rated, and then there's a
slightly larger battery. But I mean, we're
talking very slight here. I think it goes from 4,385
mAh to just over 4,400, but it still has wireless charging too. Then on the inside, it's been bumped up to the new Tensor G3 chip
from last year's flagships. So we know it's decently capable,
if a little, inefficient, but then it'll also start
at 128 gigs of storage. But for the first time, they're also going to offer a 256-gig version
of the A phone as well. And then around the front,
an improved display. So it's the same size, still 6.1 inches, still has the middle hole punch cutout for the selfie camera, still has an optical fingerprint reader, but it's now an Actua display. So the peak brightness is
40% higher than before, and I think it's noticeable. This is one of those things
that makes a big difference to everyday life and usability, just being able to see it outdoors. And it's now a pOLED
that gets up to 120 hertz instead of the 90 hertz like last year. Now, before you even type it, I know, a lot of people
are gonna argue immediately this is not something that
makes much of a difference to most Pixel buyers, and... you're right. In fact, many of them will
not notice this improvement just because Smooth Display is actually off again by default. So it's a 60 hertz phone out the box, and then you have to know to go into the settings and turn it on and knowing it'll impact battery life. And then even once you do, it's not like locked at 120 hertz, it's dynamic up to 120 hertz, so. I played around with this
phone for a little bit. It did feel very smooth to me. It feels nice at 120 Hertz, so I'm personally happy about that change, but I won't dwell on about
it for too much longer. So from there, you already
know what a Pixel is, right? This is the mid-range/budget
version of the phone with great software. Like, this is the one with
the really smart AI features like Call Assist and Pixel
VPN and Magic Eraser Audio and all kinds of other
classic Google features. It's the one with easily the best speech-to-text
transcription speed and accuracy I've ever used on a phone. It's reliable enough to just
write whatever you want, emails, texts, notes, whole
paragraphs as fast as you want. It's also the one that's
promised seven years of updates. OS updates, security updates,
Feature Drop updates, and it's the one with really good cameras, mostly, basically
unchanged from last year. But all the Pixel 7A did was literally get the highest Elo rating on our recent blind smartphone camera test with millions of votes up against other top-tier flagship phones, so I'd say that's a pretty good baseline. So it seems like a pretty safe bet, pretty easy bet if you
are a Google or Pixel fan. But I'll just say, here are
my worries with this Pixel. So first of all, this is
the first A series device that they're going to
enable Gemini Nano on, and Nano is the one that can go locally on the device entirely, which is great. They're probably gonna make a
big deal about it at the event and talk about it more at
Google I/O and all the stuff. But there's also now like
this weird inconsistency with different assistance
on the Pixel phone. It's not even just this phone, but now you've got the Gemini app like showing off prominently
on the home screen on these Pixel 8As, which is the latest available
and most capable voice and multimodal AI search that they have. But then the Google Search page right next to the home screen, if you tap the mic there, that's going to a totally separate but also very capable Google Voice Search with Google Assistant. Google is literally now developing two different assistants side by side with overlapping but not
fully congruent capabilities. It's just a little weird,
a little inconsistent. And we saw it coming and
we knew this would happen, but I think they'll eventually have to consolidate them all into one. I think Gemini will do
everything at some point. But then, hey, I guess the
other thing to keep in mind is the price. So again, this phone's
gonna launch for US$500. Mid-range phone, mid-range price, everything seems reasonable here. But let me remind you, you can still buy last
year's phone of the year, brand new Pixel 8 for 550 bucks. So this eight 8A right now is not that much cheaper than the 8. And if you do go with the 8, while it is a couple months old now, sure, you're also getting a
phone with thinner bezels and a brighter, higher-quality display. Arguably even better
cameras with bigger sensors, a bigger battery, faster charging, IP68, and it's the same Tensor G3. Like, is that not a way
better-feeling deal? I mean, if you can find one
used, that's even better. Pixel 8 was just such a good phone for that price that it makes phones, both more and less expensive,
feel like worse buys. Like, I talked about how Pixel 8 Pro feels like such a hard sell
because it's $250 more, but now it also kind of makes the Pixel 8A look a little too high-priced. So either way, I'm sure Pixel 9 and 9 Pro when they come
out will shake things up. But as of right now, Pixel 8A is just, it's a solid mid-ranger, solid. It's got all the stuff
you kind of already know you're getting from a Pixel. And if you also plan on
picking one of these up, then channel sponsor
Dbrand also has you covered with their Hydrodip skins. Now, I've been using Dbrand
skins literally since 2013, so that's over a decade now. And the biggest thing
for me is they basically add no thickness, obviously, to the device like a case would, but they can still totally
change the look and feel. Now, beyond just the Pixel skin and case, Dbrand also supports
with the Hydrodip skin almost 200 devices. So there's phones, but also laptops, tablets, consoles, you name it. And there's four colorways of this one, so Gold Rush, Solar Flare, Toxic Waste, and Cotton Candy. I'm thinking Gold Rush is the best looking one out of the bunch, like I'm into the black, white,
and gold combo, super clean. But honestly, they all look pretty unique. So if you have a favorite,
I'll leave a link down below so you can grab one for yourself. But yeah, that's basically it. Let me know what you think
of Pixel 8A versus Pixel 8 in this weird six-month release
stage thing Google's doing. I'll check the comments. Either way, thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace. (bright music)"
HLi2xYxZX10,"$20K vs $2,000,000 Hybrid Car!","If electric cars are the future, are hybrids the present? @TheTripleFCollection: https://www.youtube.com/@TheTripleFCollection ...",2024-04-22T16:55:14Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLi2xYxZX10,3281012,92248,"(light music)
(icons boinging) - So in a world of electric
cars, in this video, we're gonna be taking a
look at a $20,000 hybrid, a $120,000 hybrid, and
a $2 million hybrid car. So this video is part an explainer, part a chance to drive
some really sick cars. Shout out to Triple F
Collection, we'll get there. Anyway, unless you guys have
been living under a rock, you've seen that electric
cars have been having a bit of a renaissance lately, surging in popularity till
the number one best sold new car on earth is electric, but they are still very
much a new technology. Like they're obviously
awesome with instant torque and no emissions and fast acceleration, but they have these huge, heavy batteries and they take forever to recharge and there's not enough infrastructure for everyone to own them,
so there's this window now where it makes a lot of sense
that maybe for most people, a hybrid is actually the best option. Interesting. (upbeat music) (upbeat music continues) So I don't think anyone's
buying the Corolla for speed or power. I mean, if I'm being honest, it's actually still pretty zippy. So this car starts at $24,000 and it's a hybrid purely,
purely for efficiency. So the basics of this hybrid system, and many others in the same class, is that the wheels can be
driven by the gas engine or the electric motor, or both. So this Corolla hybrid
has a 1.8 liter engine and one electric motor at the front axle that deliver a combined 138 horsepower and it's powering the electric motor with a pretty small 1.6
kilowatt hour battery. So at low speeds, you've
probably been in a car like this, the car goes totally electric,
the gas engine turns off, but once you go over a certain speed, or use a certain amount of power, then it's gonna fire
up the gas engine again and it couples it with the electric motor. Then anytime you're braking or coasting, that's when it charges
the battery back up. It's as you're slowing down, it captures some of that energy, so it never actually
needs to be plugged in to charge up that small battery, and this system is good for
literally 50 miles per gallon. When you drive this car, you
literally have a game score, an eco score as you drive
of if you can slow down and roll onto your accelerations better and roll to a stop more easily,
you can gamify efficiency in this car to get your
maximum miles per gallon. So it actually divides it up. I have my eco zone, so I'm driving and if I get my little
bar in the eco zone, I'm doing a good job. And then I have starts, cruises and stops. I've gotten my eco score
pretty high, not to brag, but I've seen it in the
70s, which is pretty sick. I don't know what happens
when I get to 100, but what I do know is the
better I get that score, the more miles per gallon I get. But yeah, pretty much everything
about the rest of this car is designed around that efficiency. It's aerodynamic enough that
it slips through the air. It's got tires that have
a low rolling resistance. It doesn't have these
like sticky grippy tires. That's actually against
efficiency, in this case. So if you're looking
for a reason why someone would buy a hybrid today, it's because they're not trying to charge a huge battery
every night in their garage or rely on the grid or rely
on finding public chargers. It's 'cause they just
want better gas mileage and they wanna spend less, not
zero, but less on gas today. (car dinging) But you already know,
these cars are obviously very utility focused. They're for people who just
are going places, right? But what if you're more after
the ultimate driving machine, something a little more versatile? Then you can spend a little more money and get something like this. (beat music) All right, so this car
starts at about $100,000, a little over, and this car
is a hybrid for versatility. So the idea is this is a BMW 750e. There's a bunch of vehicles in this class, but yeah, you've spent enough
money now at this point that you can reap the benefits
of both gas and electric. So this hybrid system
has a bit more hardware to accomplish two different goals, so there's a three liter
straight six engine making around 300 horsepower, and a medium sized 14.4
kilowatt hour larger battery, powering a roughly 200
horsepower electric motor, so you're totaling around 500 horsepower. So once again, it can drive
using both gas and electric, just like the Toyota, but now there's enough battery capacity that you can also drive fully electric at totally normal everyday driving speeds up to like 30 miles on a charge without ever turning on the gas engine, and then also, unlike the
Corolla, this is a plug-in hybrid so you can directly
plug the car into a wall to replenish the battery
and just keep driving around on electric as long as you
want to with zero gas use, so it does everything in
the Toyota does, but more. I do feel like plug-in
hybrids at this moment in time are the one that make the most sense for the most people that I see driving 'em 'cause if you have a short commute, let's say you have a 10
mile commute every day and you just plug in at a charger at work or in your garage every night or during work in the daytime, you can just straight up
never pay for gas again and drive it just like an electric car, but on the off chance you
do need to drive further, go for a road trip, or
just do something more than your normal 10 mile commute, you have all the benefits of a gas car. Thankfully these hybrids
also have one crucial piece of the electric car, which
is regenerative braking, which means it's gonna
be able to recuperate a lot of the energy once
I've gotten up to speed and start filling up the
battery as I'm driving. So there's a little graph on
the dash you can see here, which means as I accelerate and I take energy out of
the battery, it goes up, but as I decelerate,
it's actually blending and friction braking with
regenerative braking, and if I drive around
like this long enough, especially if I go down
hills and break a lot, I will actually start adding to the charge of this battery too. But you know how electric cars
also have that party trick of instant torque available
at any RPM and any speed? Well, the hybrid should benefit
a little bit from that too. So because this motor is powerful enough and the battery is big enough
to provide the voltage, yes, in the sportiest mode, this car also, when you floor it, gets that initial hit from the electricity and
then follows with the surge of the rest of the power
from the gas engine. Oh, and one of the things I say a lot on the Auto Focus channel,
or I've said before, is there are certain types of cars that are best to go electric, and because of how much batteries weigh, cars that are already heavy are the best ones to go electric. So like this is a big
four-door luxury sedan. There is no attempt on
making this a small car. It's huge, it's got lots of
space, it's soft, it's cushy. This is a great type
of car to go electric, which is why the i7 is good, but yeah, there are lots
of other versions of this. The RAV4 hybrid, the
Toyota Prius Prime hybrid, all sorts of other plug-in hybrids. Yeah, if I were to recommend
one version for more people, like this, you still get all
the nice plushy suspension and all of the tech in the
car and all the screens and the way it drives,
it's the same thing, but more accessible. You don't have to have
a plug in your garage. So all that is fun. That's, I get it. It's versatile. This is why they call it the
ultimate driving machine, but you can always spend more. You can always spend more. And when you do, you end up in
the territory of specialists and this is definitely a specialist. Just give me a second. (door whirring) Hold on a second, just wanna... Okay. Now close that. (jazzy music) ♪ I've just got eyes for you ♪ ♪ No other could enchant me ♪ ♪ Darlin' like you do ♪ ♪ 'Cause I've just got eyes for you ♪ - So this car costs $2.5 million and it's a hybrid purely for performance, which I mean, you could probably
tell just by looking at it, but also by the fact that I'm sitting in the middle of the car now. I have to get used to this. This is the McLaren Speedtail. So McLaren's done this a few times. One center driver's seat,
two passenger seats, and just a whole lot of calibration for me for this insane driving position. But yeah, this thing is a hybrid. It's technically a hybrid. So this hybrid system is pretty crazy. It's very focused on
literally just going as fast as physically possible, which
is just about maximizing power and minimizing weight. So there's already a twin turbo four liter V8 engine pushing
out 750 plus horsepower, but then they've also
designed a special small, but super high-powered
1.6 kilowatt hour battery that powers a single
electric motor by itself that generates an extra
300 more horsepower. So the total is now over 1,000 horsepower and that motor is
basically just being used to help spin the wheels
even faster than the engine by itself could. There is no electric-only mode. There is no situation where
the gas engine ever shuts off. There are no efficiency goals here. This is actually really similar to the turbocharged hybrid
setups you literally see in Formula 1 today. It's just about going fast. So here's a couple of those
hilariously over-engineered pieces of this car. First of all, this is the only
car I've ever actually driven that's shipped with cameras
instead of side view mirrors, for even better aerodynamics, of course. They've also got the
electrochromic glass roof tint and windshield tint instead
of moving fabric pieces. But then also, the active
arrow on the back of this car is not just like regular pivoting parts or spoilers or anything like that, but it's literally bending
the carbon fiber body work, and all of the paint and coatings with it up and down when you're under braking to assist with slowing down. That's insane if you can
see what's happening here. And this is also the
only car I've ever seen with a wireless charger. That's right, the McLaren
Speedtail wireless charges, so the battery is at the bottom of the car and it's small enough that
if the driver doesn't park exactly over the right
spot in their garage, it's not a huge deal because, again, it's a small battery, it
shouldn't take too long and inductive charging has
never been particularly efficient, but it'll eventually work. And no, I don't think that this would fly for any fully electric car today. Everything about the outside
of this car is designed, it's sculpted to just cut through the air and that's how it does
zero to 186 miles an hour faster than a Bugatti Chiron, and 250 miles an hour in a straight line. Now, I'm gonna let you
in on a little secret about these super, super
fast electric cars. They need a huge battery to realistically make that happen, right? Let's take Tesla Model
S Plaid, for example. 1,000 horsepower, crazy high
power output from the battery, but in order to do that, they
need to give it this huge 100 kilowatt hour battery so that when you export all that power, you don't just drain the
battery super quickly, you can keep driving like a normal person. So that's why you have
these super high horsepower electric cars, but they always come with the sacrifice of weight. They're always heavy. The Lucid Air, it's fighting its weight. The EV6 GT, it's fighting how heavy it is. With a supercar like this, it's not fully electric all the time and so they're willing
to put in a tiny battery that exports a ton of power and basically drains it in seconds. So I'm gonna show you
something with this real quick. Right now I have 100% of my battery. I'm gonna do just a quick little pull and see just what a couple of seconds of electric-assisted acceleration will do. (engine revving) Way down to 74% battery, just from that little
acceleration, 100 to 74, and now it's already, it's going right back up to 100. It's almost 100 again because I'm driving and recuperating that
energy and now it's 100. This is super high-tech stuff and it actually has a lot of parallels to what we see in Formula 1. Believe it or not, those Formula 1 cars that we're watching on TV today, those are small turbocharged
hybrid powertrains. I kind of wanna do that again. (engine revving) That's what the F1 cars
are doing out there. They are recovering energy as they break, and they are spending
energy when they accelerate. And I guess that's the
difference between this and the Rimac Nevera. You remember, you probably
have seen the video I did with the quickest
electric car in the world, the Rimac Nevera, which yes,
does have a big heavy battery. It weighs like 5,000
pounds like a Model S. The crazy thing about that
car, and that's an anomaly, is that it has four electric motors, which you can kind of think of
as being treated like gears, but not really. This will have a higher top speed simply because it just keeps gearing up, seven speed gearbox, and it
pulls all the way through up to 250 miles an hour. If you want a hybrid supercar, you can kind of have both fast
and quick in the same car. This is fast and quick. I mean, it's not razor
sharp, fully electric quick, but it's close and it's,
yeah, it's the fastest, it's one of the fastest
cars you can possibly build. Yeah, so I guess my point
here with the whole video is, yes, I still fully believe
electrification is the future at every level of cars,
but in the meantime, it's pretty clear that
hybrids make a lot of sense and they've been right under
our noses the whole time. That's about it. I got your driver's speed deal. (light upbeat music)"
HN-WH7C4K0Q,Here&#39;s the Thing about the M3 Macbook Air...,"Usually it's the easiest laptop in the world recommend. This time, there's a wrinkle... Get a dbrand leather skin at ...",2024-03-20T21:20:58Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN-WH7C4K0Q,5613089,123164,"(Intro music) - That's crazy that the
most interesting things about this new laptop are
the reasons not to buy it. So the MacBook Air just got refreshed. It's a pretty simple update,
maybe a boring one actually. There's really only two things new. It has this new
anodization on the outside, apparently a slightly more
fingerprint resistant look to it. And it has the new M3 chip inside. So the coating, I don't know, it barely makes a difference
if I'm being honest. It still gets fingerprints
if you handle it regularly without a skin or a case. I would much rather depend
on something like a skin from channel sponsor Dbrand. It lets you break out
from one of the three really simple colors and
it's gonna hide fingerprints a million times better than
any metal treatment ever could. Plus these are real leather, so they have a nice plush texture and it'll patina over time. So I'll leave a link to this one below. But the other new thing
is this M3 chip inside. So we've seen this M3 chip
before, this is what Apple does. They put the same chip everywhere. This came out in October of last year and they immediately
put it in the new iMac. And then we also got a new
MacBook Pro that launched with this and the M3 PRO and the M3 Max. So okay, new M3 Apple silicon,
third generation, great. So now we're finally getting
this new base M3 chip in the new MacBook Air, side
note, why does it take so long? I don't know, it feels like
Apple kind of staggers it probably on purpose, but like
it's the same chip everywhere. They've done the iMac,
they've done the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, but the
Mac Mini just staying on M2, kind of weird. Also the new iPad Pro still on M2. When's that gonna get it? Anyway, you already know
that the MacBook Air is the most popular Mac for a reason. This is the base like entry level Mac that most people are seeing as the way to get into the Mac world. And so the base MacBook
Air has typically been one of the easiest to recommend
laptops in the world by design. But this one, interestingly,
for two reasons, isn't. Now, this has nothing to
do with performance of M3 or anything weird like that. Like it's the performance
you were expecting. If you look at benchmarks,
it's right around that 10 to 20% improvement over M2 depending on what you're doing. Definitely leans heavier on graphics improvements this generation. And there's the rate tracing now finally. So any applications or rendering that are
taken advantage of that, that's gonna be a noticeable
improvement for M3. And it's clearly a more capable chip. And also MacBook Airs,
especially the 15 inch, just constantly get great
battery life across the board. You also get now dual
external display support with the lid closed, but one external display
with the laptop open. And it also appears that the base storage
on M3 is much improved. So this was one of those concerns from, if you look back at M2, you know obviously Apple seeds reviewers with higher end MacBooks, so
most of us aren't getting that. But if you look back at M2 the base 256 gig model used
a single SSD module instead of two SSDs. Long story short, that
storage module was way slower than M1, like 50% slower on paper. Would you have noticed if nobody told you and had never benchmarked it? Maybe, possibly not, but obviously it's a bummer
having way slower storage on a new M2 and that extra
time transferring large files, that adds up over time. So I'm happy to report that
I've seen really good benchmarks on the base storage of the M3 Air. It appears that they fixed it, awesome. So what's the deal with this M3 Air then? Why am I saying it's not necessarily the best recommendation? Well, historically, MacBook
Air has been super easy to recommend, but with this M3, they also lowered the price
of M2 by a hundred bucks and discontinued the M1. So now the lineup is M3
MacBook Air starts at 1099, then M2 MacBook Air starts at 999 and then M1, it's kind of gone from Apple, but you can still find stock that's left at like Walmart or Best Buy. Now the thing about the
MacBook Air being easy to recommend is we're
talking about regular people, which it's very light, regular, normal usage like web browsing,
listening to music, a bunch of tabs open, work stuff,
occasionally compiling or rendering some small
things, photo editing and chopping a video or two sometimes, but really very light. So these people, like type of people who would buy a laptop at
Walmart would be totally fine with the cheaper identical
looking MacBook Air with the slightly slower
M2 chip and slower storage. I think they would be totally fine. But the other thing which
I need to talk about is this whole base spec thing. This is not exactly new to the
industry, but the base price and the base spec has almost
become like this weird fallacy. Like I think it was Linus who did a video about how starting at is
like the biggest lie in tech. And he's right, it's not just tech, like the car industry
does it all the time too. Starting at, you know,
this super low price, but nobody actually gets it at that price. You're not gonna get a
totally bare base model car. The base price is really
more to give you an idea of how much you're about to spend when you actually option
it up the way you want to. And the issue with these
is Apple's markup prices for above base spec is crazy high. Like Apple charges way too much
for the most basic upgrades. Obviously Apple Silicon
computers are all a system on a chip, so they cannot be upgraded ever after you buy them, right? So once you buy it, you know, you're kind of incentivized if you're
gonna keep it for a long time to splurge a little bit and give yourself some extra
headroom and future proof it and bump up that spec. But Apple charges so much
for bumping up that spec that the base price feels
like kind of even more of a lie than usual. So the MacBook Air starts in 2024, again, at eight gigs of shared
RAM and 256 gigs of storage. Now, ignoring the fact that
the phone I'm using also has more than eight gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of storage, if
you want to upgrade to 16 gigs of memory, the first available
RAM upgrade, that's $200. And if you wanna bump up
to just the half a terabyte of storage, that's
another 200 more dollars. Compared to to how much
that actually costs Apple, especially at the scale
that they're operating, that is just crazy,
brutal, ridiculous pricing. So even if you do just that, suddenly the MacBook Air M3 is $1,500. So either you're cool with
knowing you're actually buying a 1500 plus dollars MacBook
Air or the real question is, is the base spec in 2024 actually usable? And my take is actually
sometimes yes, sometimes yes. So again, if you're the
people I talked about earlier, you're you're buying a laptop
from the showcase at Walmart or Best Buy, you just need
it to do the basic stuff I mentioned earlier, you actually can do that with eight gigs of shared memory, no problem. This might seem like a hot take, but I've spent a lot of
time doing this stuff. You rarely actually get
close to hitting the max and hitting memory swap. And even when you do,
it's very much still fine. It's when you get into the
heavier stuff like media encoding or exporting or gaming that
it's a whole nother story. So if you're watching this video, you already know which
group of people you're in. So for that massive group of
people who are doing a lot of that normal, baseline computing stuff, don't buy the new M3 MacBook Air. You can very easily get an M2 MacBook Air and save your money. Matter of fact, if you don't
need the brighter display, the MagSafe, the external display support, which you probably don't at this rate, it's also a great idea
to look into Best Buy or Walmart's like six,
$700 M1 MacBook Airs that they're selling right now. I think Walmart first announced
they would have it for 699 and then a few days
later Best Buy announced that they'd sell it for
649, which is pretty sick. So clearly M3 is a much
more capable overall chip and brings the floor of a laptop up. But the way I see it, what
Apple silicon has done to Apple's lineup is it's
brought down the minimum level of machine that you can get
away with doing your workflow. Does that make sense? So like me, I edit a lot of videos and so I need a powerful
machine for Final Cut Pro and that sort of stuff, right? So for the longest time I could
only use an Apple Desktop, the highest end iMac Pro, the
Mac Pro, and I still will, but I am now able to use Mac
Studio and I can actually edit. I've had an M1 Max MacBook Pro for a while and I've been editing
on the go with a laptop, which is a huge like enabler for me. And the same sort of thing
applies if you're doing like gaming stuff or if you have
a whole bunch of coding and heavy, maybe even just encoding photos or whatever you're doing at that level, you'd typically rely on a MacBook Pro. But with these new chips
and with Apple silicon, you can do that on a high-end
MacBook Air, which is again, a pretty sweet enabler. So that's what the new M3 MacBook Air is. If you do that sort of stuff,
it's an amazing computer. It should be on your shortlist. Great all around, easy to recommend. But again, if you're doing
the lightweight, normal stuff and you need a MacBook
Air, don't get this one. Get the cheaper one. Okay, that's it. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys the next one, peace. ♪ It's the money, it's it's

VdOlqcg9uMQ,Nothing Phone 2A Review: Flashy Good Deal!,Nothing Phone 2a is an impressive and smooth phone for $350! Get a dbrand something skin at ...,2024-03-05T12:28:28Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdOlqcg9uMQ,3186737,99301,"(cube bounces) (electronic crackling) - Budget phones are fun, because, pretty much with all of them, if you poke around hard enough, you will find the thing that
they had to cut corners on, you'll find the thing
that they trimmed back to get it to be a budget phone. And so for picking one for
you, it's just a matter of picking the one that
makes the trade offs that you're okay with. Like maybe you love, you gotta have good build
quality and cameras. Well then, iPhone SE is
probably a good one for you. And then you know you're
not gonna get a great screen or battery life or things like that. Or maybe you gotta have
a great big screen. Samsung makes the Galaxy A54. Ar maybe you gotta have
good software and cameras. Pixel 7A. This phone is 350 bucks. And this, this is the designer one. (sophisticated electro-jazz music) (electronic crackling) So, this phone is not
going to win anyone over with raw specs. It's not gonna win by
having the best camera or the best battery life
of any budget phone. The performance isn't gonna
blow you outta the water, but you could definitely argue that it's the prettiest $350 phone. So Nothing has had this
transparent aesthetic going for a while with their phones, and then also the earbuds. This one definitely also has that. There's also a white version of this. I think it looks better, it
also has like black buttons, so it's kinda this nice contrast, but, you know, dark
version looks cool too. And honestly if the mission is
to look like a Nothing phone, and not be mistaken for anything else, then, yeah, mission
definitely accomplished. The dual cameras in the
middle and near the top is pretty unique. Kinda like a pair of eyes maybe. And the NFC coil actually
surrounds the cameras. Then there are three bars of
LEDs making a glyph design around the camera circle again. Then it's kinda this split design, the bottom half is like
a PCB-inspired look, apparently inspired by the
New York City subway map. And Nothing's already shown people this, like there's been some
reactions to the design already. Some people love it, some
people actually hate it. I don't know, it's a bit asymmetrical, so it's unconventional for
sure, but I think it's nice, not gonna lie. But even if you don't like
it, at least you can say it's at least somewhat
visually interesting. You know, there's some textures,
there's some exposed screws and some text and that little red square, it's not functional, it's
just purely to look cool, so, I appreciate that. And if you do like this look but have maybe a more boring phone that you're not willing to give up, then channel sponsor dbrand has you covered with
their Something skins. So if you haven't heard of it already, dbrand has performed some, and these are their words, not mine, ""Creative plagiarism"" on
Nothing's whole design language, both in light mode and dark mode, so I'll leave a link below
if you wanna check those out. But guess what? It's an extremely
competitive price bracket, so you get a good looking phone, but you still will have to
make some sacrifices to get it. So first of all, it's clear
plastic, not glass, at the back. Which, you know, I'm sure Zach will get to
this phone at some point, but I think it'll be easier
to scuff and scratch, but harder to shatter,
like glass would be, so, but I think it's a
reasonable trade off. It's also a textured
plastic frame as well, so it looks like aluminum, but it's this plastic all
the way around the phone, to the point where this phone
actually ends up feeling surprisingly light in the
hand for how big it is. But we should just get to that, this is a huge, it's a
jumbo-sized phone, it's gigantic. Some people might not love that, but I think a lotta people
like really big screens, and you get the natural advantages that come with a big phone, which is a big battery and a big screen. So this is a relatively
giant 6.7-inch display corner to corner. It's literally ultra phone size. And it gets pretty bright too, so definitely not flagship bright, 'cause we have some
crazy numbers these days, but 1300 knits peak brightness is very visible in bright indoor lighting, and bezels are even all the way around the front of the phone, so, aesthetically, I have no complaints. And then even at this price, it's AMOLED, it has an optical fingerprint
reader under the glass. Its variable refresh rate up to 120 hertz. And it even has 2160 hertz PWM dimming. So if you don't like
the back of this phone, at least the front of it, that you're actually
looking at all the time, is pretty impressive for 350 bucks. But I'd say an even bigger
strength to this phone is battery life. So battery always comes from
three main things, basically, obviously having a huge physical battery. Also good software and an efficient chip. We'll get to the software. But, this phone has a
5000-milliamp hour battery, that's literally bigger than their flagship phones from Nothing, so, really big battery. It doesn't have wireless charging, but it does have 45-watt wire charging. Which is pretty good, that's
zero to full in an hour. And the chip it's running
is this little thing called the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro. So, this was my biggest
question mark, actually, going into testing this phone, 'cause, you know how Nothing teases the specs and stuff ahead of time. So we find out it's a MediaTek chip, and I'm not sure if this
one's going to perform the way I've been used
to some other phones, like they're showcasing
all these, you know, specifically handpicked
benchmarks results, of course they will, but
conveniently, they only compare it to a two-year-old Nothing Phone 1 which had that mid-range,
778G Plus from Qualcomm. Now, I'm not expecting
flagship stuff for 350 bucks, but like, what's it gonna land at, this feels like a make or
break part of the phone. And I've been pleasantly surprised. Now, it's not gonna win
any prizes with raw specs, and I definitely don't think
it'll earn anybody's money with the benchmark scores alone, you look at those numbers, you're like ""Okay, not
a total shock here."" But as far as actual performance,
when you use the phone, the way I'd put it is, it's respectable, and I really feel like that is
a testament to the software, and how well it's working together. So, at this point we're on Nothing OS 2.5, on top of Android 14. And you already have seen
Nothing Phone software with the dots and the
aesthetic and all that stuff, but, it's clean, there's no bloat wear, and there is a solid
focus on fast and smooth, it kinda feels like a throwback to the old OnePlus Magic back in the day. But with regular use, this phone
is quite smooth and snappy. Sometimes a fingerprint
reader shudders a little bit, like when you're first unlocking, but for the most part, if you're just using the phone
doing stuff like messaging or flipping through a couple
apps, email, web browsing, taking your pictures,
this is a smooth phone. It's pretty similar to what they did with the Nothing Phone 1, with this 778. It's very solid with everyday use, and the second you try to
do super high-end stuff, like gaming, then you'll see where the
benchmarks come up short, where you start dropping
frames and all that. But, again, this is a $350 phone and I am definitely not
complaining about that. Now Nothing has had some time now to build up their aesthetic
and their identity and what they really want
a Nothing phone to be. And I gotta say, they
have a lot of unique, really identifiable things going on here that you may like or dislike,
but they're all here. So aesthetically they've
got the dots everywhere. So the stock apps have
this dots aesthetic, and the thin font to go with it. The back arrow in Android
is made of these dots. And they have this extensive
built-out selection of Nothing widgets now, most of them with the dots theme as well, so you can have this very
consistent home screen aesthetic. And then there's other little stuff, like you can enlarge a single app icon to fill up four spots on your home screen for a unique home screen grid. I don't know, you might be into that. There's also this nice little animation with the folders on the home screen. Also this new thing which
lets you add a glass effect to your wallpaper, so it's blurred behind your home screen for better visibility, I
actually really like that. There's also AI wallpapers now, so you can jump into the wallpaper studio and create the most soulless combo art the world has ever seen
in just a few taps. There's also third-party icon pack support on the home screen, with
instant one-touch previews. And then of course the glyphs. So, this phone still has
some lights on the back, it's less lights that the
flagship, than the phone two, but, about the same
amount of functionality. So there's one vertical
light on the right, and a small one down
here on the bottom left, and then the big top one
arcing around the top left. This is the one that works
with the glyph countdown timer. Maybe you'll find that useful. The blinking notification
glyph when your phone is down, I still wish I could just
customize it a little bit more, I know they don't wanna do
RGB, but if this was RGB, I would totally have different colors light up for different app notifications and I would go to town
with that, but, you know, it still works with just white lights. And it also does music visualizations to sync up with any music
coming out of the speaker, so... (phone plays electro-R&B music) I don't know. Sure. Obviously some of this stuff is gimmicks. Some of this you may find
useful like once or twice, I almost never use the countdown clock, but the one time I use
it, it's kinda cool. Side note, I couldn't
get the glyph composer to work at all on this phone. The UI worked, but it didn't light up
the lights on the back. But you know, on super closeup photos, maybe the glyph fill flash
is decently useful sometimes, useless other times. But hey, while we're on
the subject, the camera. The cameras on the back
here are serviceable, like, it's just practical to have cameras on the back of your phone, and these, they're not
good, but, they're fine. I always feel like we go
into budget phone reviews kinda knowing, okay, this isn't gonna have
cameras that blow me away, it's not gonna be as
interesting to test these, but, you gotta test 'em anyway
and see what they're made of, so, this has a different new 50-megapixel primary
camera on the back, and then it has the same ultra-wide camera as the Nothing phone too, and actually also the same selfie camera. And look, it can take okay pictures. Alright, passable pictures. I know 50 megapixels is a big number, but, here's what I'll say: at this level, even in great lighting, the photos aren't particularly sharp. The dynamic range or depth
of field aren't amazing. Like, you're not buying this phone to take the greatest most
artistic photos and videos the world has ever seen. But, what you do need is
for it to be serviceable, to be quick enough for autofocus to work, for it to capture a moment,
document scanning, video calls, sharing photos with people. And it does all that,
and it's totally fine, and I can't complain. And really what's left a
bigger imprint on me using this is that, compared to their
other flagship phones, almost all of the features are still here. Like the only one I'm not actually seeing on this budget version of
the phone is macro mode. And that, that theme of
keeping a lotta the stuff from the more expensive phones and not doing these artificial cuts, that's what feels good about
this phone as a budget phone, to me, it actually feels like
they're trying to give people all of the Nothing phone
experience for less money. Now, we definitely can't
say it's one-to-one, there's obviously cuts,
especially with hardware, Like there's no wireless
charging, like I said. It's IP54 instead of IP68. It's plastic instead
of glass and aluminum. But, I like that once you
start to get to use the phone, especially with the software
features, experience wise, I don't feel nearly as many
artificial-feeling cuts as we've seen on other phones. Like there's no pro mode in the camera that's missing from the budget phone. All the same advanced settings,
the experimental features, all the home screen
features with Nothing OS, it's all here, on this cheaper phone. And the crazy part to me is, they obviously wanna compare
this to a lower-end phone, so they compare it to the Phone 1, and my natural instinct is
like, ""I'm ignoring that, ""of course they're comparing
it to the old phone."" But when, you actually look
at that 2-year-old phone, you kinda see how far they've come. And you look at the things that are actually better
about this budget phone. This Nothing Phone 2A has
a bigger, brighter screen, with thinner bezels. It has a larger battery,
with faster charging, a higher-processor clock speed, a higher-resolution front camera, and a wider variety of refresh
rates than the Phone 1. Like, no wonder they
wanna show us the Phone 1. But, in general, if you're
looking for the TLDW, yes, this is a good, solid,
all-around budget phone. And the way Nothing has
been tracking with software, it appears, I mean they're promising three years of Android
updates with this phone. I think this will be a
good budget phone to own for the next couple years. Well done, Nothing. Well done. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Base."
7DfXKkvjW-E,OnePlus Watch 2 Review: Total Redemption!,Hybrid powertrain in a smartwatch. Now that's an idea. OnePlus Watch 2: https://geni.us/OvNKUCz MKBHD Merch: http://shop.,2024-02-27T22:25:47Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DfXKkvjW-E,2446375,74703,"(upbeat music) - So this smartwatch has one really interesting
trick up its sleeve that I haven't seen in any
other, and that, honestly, I don't think we're ever gonna see again. So at this point we know what a smartwatch is already, right? This is a stable, mature category. They deliver mostly across the board on all the same functions. And aside from the one crazy trick, this one is no exception. This is the OnePlus Watch 2, three years after the
original OnePlus Watch and it costs 300 bucks. So for the $300 you're spending, you're getting a pretty
nice circular watch design. It comes in this black or
silver stainless steel body and a sapphire cover glass over a 1.4 inch, 60 hertz AMOLED display. Design-wise, you could argue it takes cues from maybe the OnePlus 11 or the OnePlus 12 with
the way the camera bump is melted into the side rail of the phone. They've done a similar thing here with the buttons on the side of the watch. So there's a circular button at the top and this rectangular button at the bottom. And I kind of like it. It's a nice shape. It's got this little
subtle, classy variation of just the pure circle. And then the back looks
pretty standard too. You got the four pins at the
top, those are for charging. And it has all the sensors you'd expect for a smartwatch in the middle, optical heart rate sensor, pulse oximeter for blood oxygen, and of course, it still has
the interchangeable bands, same as gen one. And the whole thing is actually both IP 68 dust and water resistant and reaches a US military
standard for durability. Basically means it can also
withstand extreme temperature and moisture and shock among other things.
(watch taps) It's not too heavy,
it's built pretty well. This display goes up to a
thousand nits peak brightness. So it looks good. It's
built well across the board. Nice. So what's the catch? What's the weird twist? Well at the beginning I
mentioned like we already kind of know what a smartwatch is, which is a tiny computer on
your wrist with a tiny screen and a tiny battery. And that's fine. Like they all tend to have
pretty short battery lives just because they're so small, and so you kind of just
charge 'em every day. And that's the way it is. Like the main competitors
here are the Apple Watch, which is 18 hours, although that's not the
most direct competitor 'cause that's the iPhone. But the Galaxy Watch, one of the best, 40 hours of battery, and the Pixel Watch, the newest one, 24 hours of battery life. But this one, OnePlus
is claiming 100 hours. 100 hour battery life in Smart Mode, which is not the battery saving mode, it's actually the
default mode out the box. 100 hours. So 96 hours is four days. I feel like, you know, 100 sounds cooler so they just went with 100. But four days of battery
sounds a lot less inconvenient. So, you know, I had to
put that to the test. So for the past four straight days I've been that guy walking around with both an Apple Watch Ultra, which claims 36 hours of normal use and this thing. Doing all the same stuff
with both watches on, getting notifications, doing workouts, just poking around the UI. And by the end, I was actually
very impressed with both. So the $800 Apple Watch Ultra actually over performed the
36 claimed hours for me. By hour 56 it was about ready to die. Now meanwhile, the OnePlus
Watch had about 15% left. Now you're probably thinking, wait, that's not even close to
100, it's like 50 something. But OnePlus told me that if you turn the always on display off, that's good for two more
days of battery life, it's actually off by default. I turned it on for this test, but that would get you well
over the 100 hour mark. To be fair, that's also probably true about the Apple Watch Ultra. Now one detail to consider
that I think actually mattered for this particular test. I've been wearing hoodies a lot 'cause it's that type of weather. And so even with the sleeves
on this Chevron Hoodie, which I'll link it below 'cause you probably wanna check it out. It covers the watch. And so when you cover the
watch with your sleeve, it thinks it's in the dark 'cause the light sensors are covered so it turns the brightness
way down on the watch. And so I think that's why it outperformed the battery numbers that it's claiming is 'cause I had a sleeve
over it a lot of the times and the brightness was low. But even still, this $300 watch outperformed this $800 smartwatch
just in terms of battery. Now here's the thing. The way that they're
achieving this battery life is, I think, more interesting
than the battery life itself. This is the twist. See, most smart watches
have a chip inside, computing everything, with some high powered cores
and some high efficiency cores to balance out power and battery life. This watch has two entirely
separate processors and two different operating systems running for each of them. So there's a high powered
Snapdragon W5 inside, that's powering Wear OS 4 and that only lights up for
things connected to that. Then there's also a BES 2,700 chip that is always on and runs RTOS. And they both share the
same 32 gigs of base storage and two gigs of RAM. So Wear OS kicks on for
the more intensive tasks like maps or music playback. But the RTOS that's always on is for those basic, low power tasks: heart rate monitoring, phone calls, notifications, background stuff. It's like a hybrid car. It's really interesting. And a fully electric car,
you guys already know has all the benefits of
being really responsive but not the best range. But a gas car has a ton of range, just not as responsive as fully electric. So if you get a hybrid,
best of the both worlds, responsive and range. And this watch, it's a hybrid
with the best of both worlds, responsiveness and range. So I've been pretty impressed. You know, using this
thing, it's responsive. It has a ton of watch faces. There's a lot of custom workouts which look very familiar with tracking and everything that
still sends all the data to the OHealth app in
plenty of detail for me. I do still wish now, shoveling
snow was a workout type, but that's another story. But you know, these here are
regular weightlifting workouts. And also, can I say I
really like that it is hold to end the workout, not tap to end. So it's way harder to
accidentally stop a workout. Great idea. Also another weird quirk, this button here has a crown that rotates. But that rotation doesn't
actually do anything. It doesn't change the volume, it doesn't scroll up or down in anything. It does nothing. It's not
connected to anything. It just freely spins. apparently, that's
literally just to make it more durable upon impact. Doesn't serve any function. Also, it does have this weird hitch, that it hasn't really
gotten any less annoying, which is if I get a notification, I feel the buzz on my wrist, then I lift up my wrist and it takes like a full two seconds to show me the notification I just got. Not that two seconds is a
disaster, it's not a ton of time, but it's longer than you expect, and it kind of annoys me to have to wait in comparison to other watches, which will just show me the
notification right away. And I feel like you can
actually see the moment that it fires up the Snapdragon W5 and Wear OS kind of snaps
on right in front of you before it shows you that notification. It's very odd. But here's the other twist on top of everything we've already talked about. I don't think this dual chip system is all of the magic creating
this great battery life, because this watch also has
a 500 MilliAmp hour battery. Now 500 MilliAmp hours
doesn't sound like a lot, but here's the sizes
of other smart watches in competition with this
and their battery sizes and how long they last. And it's a little bigger
than you'd expect. Now if I gave the Pixel Watch 2, which also has a
Snapdragon W5, by the way. If I gave the Pixel Watch 2
a 500 MilliAmp hour battery, do we think it would last 50 hours? I don't know, but there you go. Honestly, at the end of the day I just came away from
this mostly just impressed that they actually kept the
price of this watch so low. Because two chips and two OSs and the work that goes into that, I dunno, to me that just sounds expensive and it's really not missing
anything else too drastic. I think it's competitive in a
lot of good ways at 300 bucks. So I think the clear positives would be: a nice design, really classy
looking design, nice display, dual frequency GPS, so
that's for better accuracy, and then of course
really good battery life. The four days we talked about is awesome, but if you put on power saver mode, it's up to 12 days of battery life. Now this is gonna disable a
lot of the Wear OS things, so it's just basic stuff,
exercises, heart rate monitoring, but you could get it to really
last a week if you wanted to. But then the weaknesses are definitely the delay in
checking your notifications. The haptics also aren't that nice, and there's no iPhone compatibility, but you already knew that. But I would also say the
charger is not that cool. Honestly, it's kind of clunky. I mean it works perfectly
fine, don't get me wrong, but it's just like a big plastic block with pins and magnets in it. But it'll get you a full
day's charge in 10 minutes and a full charge in an hour. So that's acceptable. But for 300 bucks, I'd say
OnePlus has redeemed itself from its previous
efforts in smart watches. It's pretty good. Like in a world of smartwatch gimmicks, there's the one with earbuds inside, there's the one for fitness, there's the one for the iPhone. Maybe this is the one
with the hybrid system and pretty good battery life. (upbeat music)
Maybe that's enough for you. Let me know in the comments below. Either way, that's been it. Thanks for watching. Catch you the next one. Peace. (upbeat music)"
